00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, my god!

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,500
I can't believe it!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,800
I just won an art contest.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,300
Aah!

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Thanks.

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,600
I still don't understand why
you wanted me to say that.

7
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,300
Shut up.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,600
I got her! Ooohhh...

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,900
not cool, dwight.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,100
Not cool, man.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,200

<font color="#ffff00">Sync:mzinfo</font>

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,900
The office s5e25

14
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,900
Oh no!

15
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,900
I still have the lease On the
michael scott paper company,

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,200
So occasionally
i will sneak down here

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,900
For a little coffee
and dancing.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,700
I actually dance
all the time.

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,700
Tiptoeing around corporate,
it is a ballet.

20
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,100
When i am breaking
all the rules,

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm break dancing.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,100
And expresso.

23
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Guys, i'm scared.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,300
I'm really scared.

25
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,300
I think i'm growing
into a giant,

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,000
Because look at this
normal-Size coffee cup.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Looks so tiny
in my giant hand now.

28
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Anybody want to go to lunch
with me later on?

29
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,500
- I do.
- Okay, how about a woman? Pam?

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
Oh, i can't do lunch.

31
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,400
I was just sending you an eil.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Jim and i need to leave early today
To meet with our contractor.

33
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,700
Oh, really? Okay. 

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,900
Just sent it.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What about the rest of you?

36
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
At dunder mifflin,

37
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,200
there is a very strict
No-Lunch-With-The-Boss policy.

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,000
And i don't know
who instituted it.

39
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,700
I think it started right after
my precessor stepped down.

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,400
But at the michael scott
paper company,

41
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,200
I really enjoyed having lunch
with pam and ryan every day.

42
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,200
So rules be damned, I want to
have lunch with these people.

43
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Who else? Who else?
Ryan.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,200
I don't do lunch. I'm doing
five small meals a day now.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,900
Now that i'm back to doing
the job Of a temp again,

46
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I find that food is one thing
i can control.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
Okay, anyone?

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
Anyone at all.

49
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
Accounting?

50
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,400
I am accounting on you
to go to lunch with me.

51
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,000
No, i don't want to stay late
to have a two-Hour lunch.

52
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,900
Michael, we have a lot
of work to do.

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,600
What?!

54
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,000
- Work.
- Oh, well, god!

55
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,500
What happened to you people?
We are just office drones.

56
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,000
We are office drones.

57
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,800
All we do is work...
is work...

58
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,900
if you don't take out his battery,
He just keeps going all day

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Oh, no,
your battery fell out.

60
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,300
I was just learning to love.

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
Hi, guys.
How are you doing?

62
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,500
Erin, 

63
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,900
how many times do i have to tell you? It is
not necessary for you to ask uhow we are doing

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,200
Every time you interact with us.

65
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,000
You're right.
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,100
Now, 

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
how can i help you?

68
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,300
Did somebody here leave a map
in the printer To youngstown, ohio?

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,700
Attention, office.

70
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,300
Who here is planning a trip
Tooungstown, ohio?

71
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,800
I will take your silence to mean
That you're all hiding something.

72
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,900
This location is
the superior court--

73
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,100
So if someone's going
to a court, big deal.

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,900
It is a big deal.

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,300
'Cause there's only a handful of reasons Why
someone would ever go to a courthouse in ohio,

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,100
And not be charged
with a crime.

77
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,500
To claim ainheritance
from a deceased relative.

78
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,500
To obtain a learner's permit
At age 14 1/2 instead of 15.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Erin, let me see
your birth certificate.

80
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,000
Sure.

81
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,300
There are other reasons
to go to ohio.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,900
We're getting married today.

83
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,500
So it turnsut it's the closest place
To get a marriage license

84
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,700
Without a three-Day
waiting period.

85
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,600
Tell 'em how it happened.

86
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,400
Okay, so we're going through
all the wedding plans,

87
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,200
And boy, it is complicated.

88
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
- And very expensive.
- Very expensive.

89
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,400
'Cause you say you want
a small wedding And that's great.

90
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,900
But then you have to invite--

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
- You can't leave anyone out.
- No one.

92
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,100
Okay, just get
to the good part.

93
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Right. Oh, so this morning We are 

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,200
- having breakfast together...
- mm-Hmm.

95
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,400
And i just looked up
from my cereal And i said, 

96
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,100
"you know what
i want to do today?

97
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
I want to marry you."

98
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,700
I had just woken up.
I didn't look cu.

99
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,900
That's how i knew
heth me eaofntfi icet.

100
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,100

101
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,700
Michael,
sorry to bother you.

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,200
Are you gonna be working
down here?

103
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,000
- Do you want these down here?
- No work! No work! No work!

104
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,200
I come in here
to relieve frustration. Ooh, 

105
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,500
ahh, ahh, ooh!

106
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
Well, i like to swim.

107
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,500
That's good.

108
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,700
Ou have a cool place
to come hang--

109
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
If you ever want
to come down here,

110
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,900
Door's always open.

111
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
Lock's broken, so...

112
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,400
thank you.

113
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Come on in.
Hey, hey, here we go.

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,100
- Yeah!??? 
- There we go.

115
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,600
Now you got it. Now you got it.
Yeah, i do got it.

116
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,300
- Hey, you want some espresso?
- Oh, yeah.

117
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,800
Gotta keep yourself
dehydrated

118
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,600
- That's rule number one.
- Okay.

119
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,600
I love it.
I love it.

120
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,600
???

121
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,000
Guys, 

122
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,200
i believe that i have figured
out What is up your butts.

123
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,700
There's no reason
to be scared.

124
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,000
The bad man is gone.
Charles is gone.

125
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,700
Charles really did a number
on these guys.

126
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,600
They are way too focused
on work.

127
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
When i was in charge,

128
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,600
This place was like
dave & buster's.

129
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,300
People just hanging out,
having fun, eatin' apps.

130
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know, it's like...

131
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,700
dave died or something.

132
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,700
Daddy's here, and daddy's
gonna take care of you.

133
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,500
Please don't refer
to yourself as our daddy.

134
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,700
I am your big daddy...

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,800
and i am gonna kiss
the boo-Boo.

136
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,300
Widdle andy is afwaid.

137
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
- Andy'safwaid?
- Yes.

138
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you all afwaid?

139
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,300
- No.
- Daddy's here for you,

140
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,300
my widdle angels.

141
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,700
Okay, 

142
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,600
i think that i have figured a way
To get you guys out of your funk.

143
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
- What?
- Funk is the problem.

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,100
And the solution.

145
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,300
- That makes sense.
- I have taken
my downstairs office,

146
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,600
And i have turned it
into a place to hang out.

147
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,900
A place where unattractive and
attractive people Can get together 

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,900
to meet, to greet,

149
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,200
To see the ones
that you love.

150
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,500
To love the ones
that you see.

151
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,000
Is this our punishment for not
wanting To have lunch with you?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,900
Why don't you
get over lunch, oscar?

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,900
Everybody else is past it.

154
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,900
All work and no play
Makes michael a dull boy.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
This is like
a haunted coffeehouse?

156
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,500
No, dwight is confusing you.

157
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,600
It's more of a disco.

158
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,200
A haunted disco!

159
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,300
With coffee,
but without the haunting.

160
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,600
It's a combo dance house
coffee bar?

161
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,500
It is a daytime disco
on the ground floor

162
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Of an industrial office
building.

163
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,300
It's a cafe disco.

164
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,100
Exactly.

165
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,000
So, like, a disco cafe.

166
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,300
No, no.
Not even close.

167
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,800
I can't force you to go down,
but i can entice you.

168
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm gonna be down there.

169
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,700
Erin will be down there
from time to time.

170
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,600
And all-You-Can-Eat
espresso.

171
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,700
Well, kevin, i guess
it is just me and you.

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,500
- Yeah.
- Holdin' down the fort.

173
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,100
Yeah.

174
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
This place is great.

175
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,000
- Thank you.
- Oh, my god, kevin.

176
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,300
I am still on hold.

177
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,700
You were supposed to get the answer
from michael And come back up.

178
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,400
- Sorry.
- This is a no-Work zone.

179
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,300
Please respect the lei.

180
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,600
- Hmm?
- Yeah, respect the lei.

181
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
Come.

182
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,900
Kevin, stay.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
Kevin, come.

184
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,000
Kevin, stay.

185
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,700
Kevin, come!

186
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Stay, stay.

187
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,600
- Come on, right now.
- Cookie, kevin. Cookie.

188
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,400
There is no cookie, kevin.

189
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
- Is there a cookie?
- Mm-Hmm.

190
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,300
- Wha--
- Come on.

191
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,500
Oh, for goodness sakes,
kevin!

192
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,300
There's no cookie.
There's no cookie. Come on! 

193
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Come.

194
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,900
I wanted a cookie.

195
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,300
Completely unacceptable.

196
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,600
Now i know what the founders
of philip morris felt like.

197
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:19,400
You just want to
give people a smooth, 

198
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,400
fun way to relax.

199
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:26,700
And suddenly you're just
some terrible monster.

200
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
Here we go.

201
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Ow!

202
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,300
Oh, what the hell.

203
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,600
Hi, jessica.
Is bob in?

204
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,700
Oh, he's on a call.

205
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
I'll just duck my head in.

206
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:14,500
It's pretty important.
He wouldn't want to be disturbed.

207
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,000
Can i give him a message
before he gets off?

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,500
Tell him i'm going dancing
downstairs in the storage closet

209
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,800
Between the bathrooms that
used to be a utility shower,

210
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,300
And he should join me there.

211
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,900
I'll let him know.

212
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,700
Mm-Hmm.

213
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
Phyllis?

214
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,200
Hey.

215
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

216
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,500
I like.

217
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
All right.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
Back. There you go.

219
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,500
There you gogood.

220
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:56,600
Ooh, show me some attitude.
Ho ho ho!

221
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,100
- Oh, *** god!
- Oh, no, no, no.

222
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,400
Oh, wow!
What did you do?

223
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,200
- You didn't do that.
You're okay. You're okay.
- Yeah.

224
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,900
Let's lie down. Here we--
You wanna go down?

225
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,300
- alright
- Whoa! Sorry. Ugh!

226
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
That's okay.

227
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
That solved the problem.

228
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,900
- ???
- Ooh! It's right here.

229
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,600
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I got your text. Who's philip?

230
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
No, no, no.

231
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,000
Who tipped you over?
Was it philip?

232
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
It's my back.

233
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
It's her back We just--
We need-- Okay, let's--

234
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,700
- Call a doctor.
- You know what,
we're gonna take care of you.

235
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,400
We're gonna get you help.
Come on. Come on.

236
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,900
- Come back.
- No, no, no. This is no good.

237
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,900
Yeah, yeah.
Back injuries are common.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,100
Not as common as knee injuries,

239
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,300
But more common than
than wrist injuries.

240
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,800
I don't need
a history lesson, okay?

241
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,900
What do you think
history is?

242
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,400
Just-- We need to get her out of there
Because no one is going to want to go in there

243
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,300
With a woman writhing around
on the floor.

244
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,900
Wait, wait, wait.
But most importantly,

245
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,500
We need to get her some
medical attention asap. Stat.

246
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,000
Rrroar!
Ramming speed.

247
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
Here we go. Here we go.

248
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,500
Out of the way.
Move it or lose it.

249
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,500
- You having fun?
- Oh, my god, what happened?

250
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,200
Oh, just having too much fun.
Phyllis, we're gonna put you in here.

251
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,400
Dwight's gonna take care of you.

252
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,000
What? No. I ought we were going
to the hospital.

253
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,600
If you want to get sick,
you go to a hospital.

254
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,800
Okay, dwight.
Okay, good.

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,700
I do not want anybody
to worry.

256
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,400
- What happened to phyllis?
- Ooooh, you know.

257
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,600
Nothing. She's--

258
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,100
We were hanging out
at cafe disco,

259
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,100
And she had a flare-Up
of an existing injury.

260
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:28,700
But she's a tough old bird, so...

261
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,100
can you please go back to work Instead
of masterminding these situations

262
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,500
Wherein we hurt ourselves.

263
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Okay, fine.
Phyllis did injure herself.

264
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,800
But she injured herself
having fun.

265
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:41,700
And i don't think she would
trade that memory for anything.

266
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,900
I would like the memory of a day
uninterrupted By this nonsense.

267
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,100
You all took a life
here today.

268
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,800
You did.

269
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,500
The life of the party.

270
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,900
- Erin...
- yes?

271
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,200
I want you to go downstairs,

272
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,100
And i want you to shut it down.

273
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
You mean, like, unplug the coffee
machine And bring it up here?

274
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,600
I don't care; bury it.

275
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
I hope you're happy.

276
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,200
Okay, 

277
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,800
i'm gonna need
two able-Bodied men.

278
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,100
Cafe disco.
More likecrappedisco.

279
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, bad.

280
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,300
There's girls in there.

281
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
- Where?
- The other room.

282
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,000
- What other room?
- Down the hall.

283
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,900
- There's girls in there?
- What'd i just say?

284
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,300
- You get me my sandwich?
- Forget the sandwich.

285
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,800
Girls. Girls!

286
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
I guess they got
what they want.

287
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,300
I am eating alone.

288
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,500
Might as well be dinner.

289
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,700
Comfy? All right.
All right.

290
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,000
Just relax. Relax, okay?

291
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,600
Dwight. Dwight!

292
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
Come on, relax. This shirt
wasn't doing you any favors.

293
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,900
If my assessment is correct,
You grind your teeth?

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,500
I do.

295
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
No kidding.
She sits three feet from me.

296
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,600
It's the most annoying
thing. Unh, unh.

297
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,300
Like children singing
christmas carols.

298
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,300
Oh, yeah, i'm wanting
the vibe down here.

299
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,700
Ashley, you made it!

300
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,100
You invited someone?

301
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,800
Oh, yeah.
Was i not allowed to do that?

302
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,200
I don't know, i've been here
eight years, And i've never--

303
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,500
Rude.

304
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm not sure, but i'm pretty sure
I'm in a Cafe disco

305
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,600
Cafe disco is dead, But i can
still hear the music in my head.

306
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,400
I hear it too, boss.

307
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,900
Better than imagined it.

308
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,800
That feels good, dwight.

309
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
Tell me where it hurts.

310
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,500
Right-- Ooh!

311
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,100
Right there.

312
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,100
Oh, yeah. You've got
a knot in your crest.

313
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,900
This remedy has been passed down
in my family for generations

314
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,800
And it always works.

315
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,200
My grandfather was told that diamond
dancer Would never race again.

316
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,700
They were wrong.

317
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,200
He came in ninth
in the apple creek derby.

318
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,800
And his jerky came in third
the following year.

319
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,600
A majestic beast.

320
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,900
So fast, so tender.

321
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,400
Welcome, welcome.
Cafe disco. I am michael scott.

322
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
Hey, angela, welcome to--

323
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,000
Stop it.

324
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
Angela, angela, angela,

325
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,100
May i interest you in a triple
expresso, Or perhaps a dance?

326
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,500
No. I didn't come down here
to get wet and wild.

327
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,800
I just need you
to sign these.

328
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,500
Oh. All right.

329
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,100
There you go.

330
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,100
- You need to sign them all.
- No, no, no. ???

331
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
One signature for every song.

332
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,700
Look, i hate to bethatperson,

333
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,100
But i just don't like
the general spirit of music.

334
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,500
I know, i know. Angela, a lot of
people doubted cafe disco at first,

335
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,100
But it is a magical place.
You have to give it a chance.

336
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,900
If these walls could talk,
they would say,

337
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,200
"This is a magical place.
You are safe here.

338
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,800
We are talking walls.
We're not going to eat you."

339
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
No!

340
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,800
This is oil from the gland
of an otter.

341
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,100
It keeps their fur water-Resistant
As well as traps heat.

342
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,900
Now i need you to lie still
for an hour.

343
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,100
An hour?
I can't stay here an hour.

344
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, girl.
Whoa.

345
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,000
Whoa.

346
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,700
Boss, this used to hang
from my windshield,

347
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,000
But it belongs in here.

348
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,000
