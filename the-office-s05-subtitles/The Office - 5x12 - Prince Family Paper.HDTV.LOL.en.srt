1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,490
what's this?

2
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,940
looks like a red wire.

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,580
that wasn't here before.

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,390
well,it's a computer,dwight.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,800
i mean,computers have wires.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,830
yours doesn't.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,420
doesn't it?

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,350
no.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,390
it's going in a different direction than the other wires.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,830
dwight,i'm really busy.i can't talk about this anymore.

11
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:49,180
here.

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:49,980
dwight!

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,830
-just shut up,phyllis.
-get outta here.

14
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,440
what are you doing?

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:12,530
i got 500 feet of red wire at a flea market up by dunmore high school.

16
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:17,560
20 bucks for the whole spool.crazy.what a deal.

17
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,220
oh,he'll be fine.

18
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,020
i made it up there.

22
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,280
what you talkin' 'bout,wallace?

23
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,850
hi,miael.how are you?

24
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,910
hi,m well.how are you?

25
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:03,690
very good.

26
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,690
so,listen,as you know,we haven't yet filled the regional supervisor job.

27
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,940
oh,have you not?

28
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,090
correct,and i was wondering if i could get you to do some of the fieldwork

29
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,690
that would normally go to the supervisor.

30
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:20,680
okay,there's an area from carbondale to marshbrook where we've never done any business.

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,220
there's a small company there,prince paper.

32
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,550
i can't get a report on it because it's not a public company.

33
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,810
but we've been talking about going after their market.

34
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,000
so i was hoping you could do some fact-finding for me.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,880
okay.

36
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,970
so i'll fax over some of the things we're looking for,okay?

37
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,110
fax? why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?

38
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,080
look,this is important,michael.

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,840
oh,well,then e-mail it,david.

40
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,190
you've got no taste,stanley hudson.

41
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,590
oh,i do.

42
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,750
what are you guys talking about?

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,190
some actress.whether she's hot.

44
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,650
who's the gal in question?

45
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:56,700
-hilary swank 
-ah,hilary swank.

46
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,470
-not at all.
-she's got mean eyes.

47
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,160
have you seen her with her bangs?

48
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,640
she looks like a monster.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,290
guys,she is a beautiful movie star.

50
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,640
so maybe we should just go to work.

51
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,520
she is an amazing actress.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,640
but that's nuestio she's not hot.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,890
yeah.thank you,phyllis.

54
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,330
okay,why don't we just put this to a vote?

55
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,560
and then we'll be done with it.

56
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,450
i'm not voting.

57
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,440
no one cares.

58
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,130
who thinks that hilary swank is hot,raise your hand.

59
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,890
okay,and who thinks that hilary swank is not hot,

60
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,220
five.five to five.

61
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,830
thank you,accounting department.

62
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,840
so what do we do now?

63
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,200
what if the owner of prince family paper has a beautiful daughter

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,270
and we have to seduce her in order to get their secrets?

65
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,330
i will seduce her.

66
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,100
no,i wanna seduce her.

67
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,210
-i'll seduce her.
-let me sede her.

68
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,110
-no,no,no.
-michael,please,can i seduce her?

69
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:46,240
i got it.

70
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,010
you'll fall in love with her.

71
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,800
yeah,so what if i did?

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,080
that would take precedence,and i would expect your support.

73
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,480
okay,so let's go over the plan again.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,360
all right,i'm a local business owner.

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,450
i needo buy paper.

76
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:00,580
i find out everything about their prices and policies.

77
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,810
your fictious name?

78
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,030
-michael scarn.
-good.

79
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,580
i am a paper salesman looking for a new job.

80
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,320
i find out everything about their expenses and salaries.

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,210
then we meet at the denny's,and we compare notes.

82
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:12,050
no,i never said denny's.ihop.

83
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:14,640
-no,i said denny's.ihop.
-we're going to ihop.you know how about ihop.

84
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,910
oh,don't start.

85
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,310
-are you a socialist?
-you know what,i don't want to get into this debate again.

86
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,520
i enjoy ihop.

87
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,610
i'll have a cup of coffee.

88
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,850
you will have pancakes,and you'll like it.

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,390
the stornefixtce to them is for lease.

90
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,640
so what?

91
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,510
it means they're not expanding.

92
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,430
maybe they're shrinking.

93
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,280
-no,no.
-they could be shrinking.

94
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,930
no,because the sign is centered perfectly above their store.

95
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,180
no sign of the sign being moved.

96
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,310
it's lunchtime.

97
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:54,230
but no sign of anyone mi in or out,which means they're not taking new customers out to lunch.

98
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,810
which means they're not acquiring new business.

99
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,360
so once again,no growth.

100
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,460
yeah,and there are clouds.

101
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,620
clouds in the sky.

102
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,860
that means it's gonna rain.

103
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
bad for business.

104
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,870
oh,it would if they were altocumulus,t cirrostratus.

105
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,190
why do you-- okay.

106
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:09,230
-michael,get your clouds right.
-whatever.

107
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,590
shut up.

108
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,280
okay.

109
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,890
so you go in now,i'm gonna go in in exactly ten minutes.

110
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,080
we have never met each other.

111
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,920
-we are complete strangers.
-right.

112
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,110
also,we're gonna need a signal to bolt outta there in case there is danger.

113
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:23,330
and that signal is-- lick your lips.

114
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,110
try it.

115
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,300
no,no,no.like this.

116
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,490
good.

117
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,950
ready to do this?

118
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,900
all right.re come the sharks.

119
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:02,020
in nature,there's something called the food chain.

120
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,050
it is where the shark eats the little shark,

121
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,800
and the little shark eats the littler shark.

122
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,210
and so on and so on and so on until you get down to the single-cell shark.

123
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,840
so now,replace sharks with paper companies.

124
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,670
and at is all you need to know about business.

125
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,430
hello.hello.

126
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,160
hello.

127
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,690
how can i help you?

128
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,920
my name is michael scarn.

129
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:33,540
i am a local business owner,and i would like to find out about your company.

130
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,140
oh,please come in.

131
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,740
thank you.

132
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,410
what kind of business are you in?

133
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,710
we're a law firm.

134
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,540
i assume your primary paper needs are stationery,general office.

135
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,530
you know,i'll be honest with you about something.

136
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,820
where i used to live,our paper supplier had a lot of big clients,

137
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,140
and i just didn't feel like a priority.

138
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:04,380
so i guess my question to you would be,how many clients do you have?

139
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,350
about 80.

140
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,320
rely?that many?

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,450
this doesn't seem like a very big operation.

142
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,310
well,it's just me,my wife,and my son.

143
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,280
ah,so when-- when did you set up shop?

144
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,950
oh,i opened this place after i came back from vietnam.

145
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,900
ooh,vietnam.i hear it's lovely.

146
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,740
each side ll have three minutes to prepare opening arguments.

147
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,760
hilary swank is attractive.

148
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,070
-hot.
-the debate is whether she's hot.

149
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,190
what difference does it make?

150
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,890
attractive,hot,beautiful-- we're talking about the same thing here.

151
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,430
huge difference.

152
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:41,110
a painting can be beautiful,but i don't want to bang a painting.

153
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,340
oh-kay!

154
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,220
tmi.

155
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,730
so even specialty paper,say 94 brightness double-bonded,

156
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,970
you would put that on the same truck as your conventional stock?

157
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,570
you sure know a lot about paper for a lawyer.

158
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,800
oh,well,that is because i am a genius.

159
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,600
oh really?

160
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,900
yes,well,about some things.

161
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,850
and other things,i'm just-- i'm very stupid.

162
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,960
like watch this.

163
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,400
is this the cup?

164
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,630
is this the cup?

165
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,710
is this what i drink out of?

166
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,900
laughter is my job.

167
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,580
tears are my game.

168
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,650
law is my profession.

169
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,500
hello.

170
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,180
i'd like to apply for a job.

171
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,480
hi,i'm afraid we're not hiring right now.

172
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,630
why don't you just get rid of this guy?

173
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,960
that's my son.

174
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,640
i'm your son now.you can visit him on holidays.

175
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,020
dwight schrute.

176
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,270
i'm a paper salesman at a second-tier paper company called dunder mifflin.

177
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:41,570
i'm the top salesman there,and i'm looking for a new challenge.

178
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,670
i would say you guys have,what,40 high-volume clients?

179
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,990
try 80.

180
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,890
80,that's nothing.

181
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:52,100
i've got 90 clients myself.

182
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,390
better look out.someone might run you out of business.

183
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,660
well,i sure hope not.

184
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,410
me too.

185
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,640
i think all of us have a tendency to view celebrities as sort of mytcal figures.

186
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,880
you know,we don't really see them as real,so therefore,we don't judge them as real people.

187
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,420
are you serious?

188
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,170
jim,just show us a picture.

189
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,680
-kevin,come on.
-yeah,shut up,kevin.

190
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,700
no,but he's making all these fancy-- it's a gut thing.

191
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,590
that's fair.

192
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,700
you know what,kev,do me a favor.

193
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,520
why don't you close your eyes?

194
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,610
okay,now imagine that hilary swank comes into this office for real.

195
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:37,730
she walks over to you and she says,[whisperin "kevin malone,i just read your online profile.

196
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,750
"and there's nothing i'd rather do than make out with you right now.

197
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,390
" now you tell me,kevin,is she hot?

198
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,900
does that end the debate?

199
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,030
or...

200
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,260
hey,kevin,what are you doing?

201
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,470
no,it's "is she hot?

202
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,930
",not "would you do her?

203
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:05,730
" respect the game.

204
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,880
oh,my god.

205
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,090
this close.

206
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,330
so why are you considering leaving dunder mifflin?

207
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,230
my boss.

208
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,510
oh,yeah?do tell.

209
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:17,760
his insensitivity could border on the cruel.

210
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,930
this is a man who does not listen to the needs of his underlis.

211
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,230
-he's way-- 
-hey,how's the interview going?

212
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,950
-it's going very well.
-don't blow it.

213
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,200
hey,linda,can i get a picture of you?

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,150
you want a picture of me?

215
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,200
i would.

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,280
could you just stand right over here?

217
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,950
that would be great.just something to remember the trip by.

218
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:42,530
just little to your left.

219
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,750
there you go.good.

220
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,120
perfect.

221
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,950
can i have a copy of that?

222
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,490
grandma,i can't do this.

223
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,940
what's going on?

224
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,750
little homework over here?

225
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,290
let's see if i can help.

226
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,830
right there.

227
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:01,200
oh-- oh,math.that's not so hard.

228
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
okay,there are four of these.

229
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,270
ignore the parenthes,right.

230
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:08,850
why is this little two so small?

231
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,510
it's-- it's weird.

232
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,960
you just-- don't-- just go by the "x.

233
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,300
" the "x" means "times.

234
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,960
so that means four times x-two.

235
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,660
what is double four?

236
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,770
-eight.
-right.

237
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:26,120
excellent.way to go.

238
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,770
nice.

239
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,300
oh,don't put that.

240
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,160
ladies and gentlemen,even though the penis was fake,

241
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,550
i kept expecting a second plot twist where we found out that hilary swank actually was a boy.

242
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,130
kevin!

243
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,510
okay,i wasn't going to dignify this discussion by getting involved,

244
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:53,040
and i dot even get the discussion-- hot is a temperature,people--

245
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,740
but kevin deserves to lose for what he said.

246
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:58,700
so,yes,she's hot.

247
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,950
she's hot as heck.

248
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,890
she's a female boris becker.

249
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,620
nice.

250
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,200
we,thank you very much for all of your help.

251
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,020
going to be an incredibly hard decision.

252
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,880
wait.

253
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,970
let me get something for you here.

254
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,930

255
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,260
our top clients.

256
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,890

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,790
okay,all right,thank you.

260
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,260
you're welcome.

261
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,620
excuse me,sir.

262
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,160
i took the bus here and was wondering if i could catch a ride home withou in your car.

263
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,500
of course.thank you very much.

264
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,840
-thanks for your time.
-thank you very much.

265
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,010
i cannot wait to contact your clients.

266
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,100
i look forward to getting your calls.

267
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,280
bye now.

268
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,920
so long.

269
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,200
oh,my god.

270
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:57,400
we struck the mother lode!

271
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,490
come on!

272
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,810
wallace is gonna freak!

273
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,830
he is going to absolutely freak.

274
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,730
someone's looking out the window.go,go,go.

275
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,910
go.peel out.go!

276
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,160
oh,shoot.

277
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,250
okay,that's-- we-- i mean,you drove over the thing.

278
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:11,260
-i know,i know,i know.
-go back-- 

279
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,520
-god,what was that?
-that's not good.

280
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,190
oh,come on.

281
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,840
no,no,no.she's hot.okay?

282
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,570
because if you are saying that hilary swank isn't hot,then you're saying i'm not hot,

283
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:33,740
because,obviously,i'm not as hot as hilary swank.

284
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,970
darn it.

285
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,870
oh,man.

286
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,670
ah,my car!

287
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,960
-not good.
-is everyone okay?

288
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,400
it sounded bad.

289
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,660
no,we're fine.we're fine.

290
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,870
you folks have done enough already.

291
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,820
you've done more than you could possibly know.

292
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,800
dwight,just shut-- okay.

293
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,330
you know,we're just gonna call a tow truck.

294
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,030
a tow truck is gonna charge you 100 bucks just to take you a mile.

295
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,360
let me-- let me take a look.

296
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,990
-no,no,you know-- 
-he dve and then backed over it.

297
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,700
it caused-- i'll be right back.

298
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,060
i'm just gonna grab my tool box.

299
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,850
don't-- 

300
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,950
ladies,are we prepared to let the kevins of the world decide anything for us?

301
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,720
anything at all?

302
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,280
we don't even give him ll internet access.

303
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,230
wait,what?

304
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,460
see that?

305
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,370
the obvious symmetry of the face.

306
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,840
it's the natural appeal of the scientific standard of koinophilia,

307
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,950
features that are a composite average of many features.

308
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:39,530
yes,she's attractive,but she is not hot.

309
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,270
how much longer is this gonna take?

310
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,310
you know,let me give you some money for this.

311
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,480
no,i sit all day.

312
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,040
it's nice working with my hands.

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:47,830
i...

314
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,220
here.

315
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,930
oh,coffee.

316
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,030
that's too much nice.

317
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,000
thank you.

318
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,280
you're welcome.

319
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,820
blugh.disgusting.what is this,instant?

320
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,620
well,that ought to do it.

321
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,400
it's all better.

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,580
thank you.

323
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,490
gosh,well,so long.

324
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:06,370
bye-bye.

325
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,970
-that looks great.
-drive safe.

326
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,020
bye!

327
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,630
look forward to hearing from you about that job application.

328
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,290
good-bye,prince family.

329
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,930
should be called the sucker family.

330
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,360
"here you go,shark.

331
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,450
"let me your fin for you "and sharpen your teeth,whe thi'e m ofatfi icet.

332
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,980
" bye-bye!

333
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,140
i'm just saying-- all i'm saying is kevin's not necessarily a feminist,

334
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,950
is all i'm saying.

335
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:03,400
dwight,what will happen to that family if i call wallace and give him this information?

336
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,450
it's simple.wallace would use that information to destroy them.

337
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:11,830
you know,our sales are fine.we're doing fine.

338
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,570
they're doing fine.

339
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,360
-could be better.
-why don't we live and let live?

340
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,200
what?

341
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,290
live and let live.

342
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,400
i'm not familiar with that expression.

343
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,190
-it's a james bond-- 
-it doesn't make any sense.

344
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,160
of course,i'm alive.

345
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,270
-i'm not going to make this cal 
-michael,you have to.

346
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,780
have you ever seen a lioness devour her cub?

347
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,540
oh,god.not this again.

348
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,270
have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?

349
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,970
have you ever seen a ccoon devour a squirrel?

350
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:33,160
my heart-- my heart says no.

351
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,460
your heart is a wonderful thing,michael.

352
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,280
but it makes some terrible decisions.

353
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,760
that's true.

354
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,700
that's true.

355
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,470
gosh.

356
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,340
it has gone down the wrong path many,many times.

357
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,610
jan,ryan...

358
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,800
yeah,save your heart for love and use your brain for business.

359
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,960
right?

360
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,040
if we don't do this to prince paper,then someone else will.

361
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,490
or worse yet...

362
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:58,700
someone else will do it to us.

363
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,470
i am trying to be more optimistic in life.

364
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,210
i've got,what,20,30 more years left?

365
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:16,170
and my family history says,i have less.

366
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:22,200
now the old stanley hudson would have found something to complain about th this actress.

367
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,490
but that's no way to live life.

368
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:33,580
look at this healthy,sexy,pretty,strong young woman.

369
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,140
come on,people.

370
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,940
she is...

371
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,250
hot.

372
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,570
and it was a terrible war.

373
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:44,230
oh,so many died.

374
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,080
far too many died.

375
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,550
but if frodo hadn't destroyed the ring,then goodness itself might have died.

376
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,560
you're right.

377
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,870
you are right.i will call wallace,and i will give him the customer list.

378
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,930
and i will give him all of my info.

379
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:09,280
you are doing the right thing,michael.

380
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,960
good.

381
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,910
so...

382
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,460
where are you going?

383
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,830
just something i have to do first.

384
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,130
where are you taking the client list?

385
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,400
someplace safe...

386
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,310
where it can't hurt anyone.

387
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,910
michael!

388
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,860

00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,170

402
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,500

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,100
those people-- it's over,michael.

409
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,430
's over.

410
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,900
i'm not a shark.

411
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,990
no!

412
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,100
okay,time for the finavo.

413
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,670
all those in favor of the resolution,"hilary swank is hot"?

414
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:48,870
okay,and all those opposed.

415
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,210
it's just ridilo.

416
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:52,080
that's the thing about debating.

417
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,590
people just t ofenfitrceenched in the view they had in the first place.

418
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:57,410
i can tell when i was talking,you were not listening.

419
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,660
this is great stuff,michael.

420
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,310
you are a titan of industry,pal.

421
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,870
-good work.
-thank you.

422
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,840
look,i'll be in touch.thanks,buddy.

423
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,750
okay.bye-bye.

424
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:15,530
well,guess whose stock just went up,golden boy?

425
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,530
i guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment.

426
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:29,250
it is bitter because i slightly destroyed a wonderful little family.

427
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:33,440
but sweet because david wallace thought i did a good job.

428
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,090
that's why i hate bittersweet chocolate.

429
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,300
i don't even-- what's the point of that?

430
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,870
why not just sweet?i mean,o-- who are you helping?

431
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,730
oh,hey,what is this?

432
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,980
hilary swank.

433
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,330
oh,she's hot.

434
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,610
yeah!

435
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,790
dam it!

436
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


437
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
