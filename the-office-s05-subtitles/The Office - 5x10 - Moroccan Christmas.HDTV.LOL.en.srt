1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,200
What is this?

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,780
happy holidays, Dwight. 

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,000
but do not open it till Christmas. 

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,750
you are so pathetic. 

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,640
how long did this take you? three hours?

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,970
five minutes, actually. 

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,900
i am a black belt in gift wrapping. 

8
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:21,000
yeah, no such thing. 

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,490
they don't give out black belts
for things that are stupid. 

10
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:25,820
well, i hope it was worth it

11
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,330
'cause i'm gonna take it apart
in about five minutes. 

12
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:30,610
i think it'll take you a little
bit longer than that. 

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,400
really?

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,040
if i can skin a mule deer
in less than ten minutes, 

15
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,640
i ought to be able to cut my--

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,760
i'm sorry, it's the
largest one i have. 

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,750
i will not be the
big guy in the tiny hat. 

21
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,650
this is the first Christmas
party i'm throwing

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,630
as head of the party
planning committee. 

23
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:27,110
the theme is "night in morocco. "

24
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,300
this isn't your
grandmother's Christmas party. 

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,600
unless, of course, 
she's from morocco, 

26
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:34,500
in which case it's very accurate. 

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,890
hey, phyllis, 

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,110
do i need this invite
to get into the party?

29
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,620
- yes. 
- awesome. 

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,210
i think this is going to be
the best Christmas party ever. 

31
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,920
Angela. . . 

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,850
you're going to move this
for the party, right?

33
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:51,580
it's not our theme. 

34
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,690
it's the nativity scene. 

35
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,510
all right. . . you can keep your camel, 

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,280
- sheep, elephant. 
- hey. 

37
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,110
and the north african king can stay. 

38
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,450
everything else goes in the drawer. 

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,170
i am not gonna judge phyllis
for desecrating Christmas. 

40
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,150
there is one person who will, though. 

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,340
and phyllis just stuffed
him into a drawer. 

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,830
i need you to get rid of the tree. 

43
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,460
- but--
- thank you. 

44
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,320
oh i don't think it's blackmail. 

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,530
Angela just does what i ask her to do

46
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,630
so i won't tell everyone

47
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,510
that she's cheating
on Andy with Dwight. 

48
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,790
i think for it to be blackmail, 

49
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:30,230
it would have to be a formal letter. 

50
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,380
ah, you brought in
your doll collection. 

51
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,490
these are not dolls, Jim. 

52
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,680
these are commodities, 
the same as gold or oil. 

53
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,180
every year i do research to determine

54
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,360
which toy will be the most
popular of the Christmas season. 

55
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,790
this year it's a doll--
half girl, half unicorn. 

56
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,680
catch phrase: "my horn can pierce the sky. "

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,110
pathetic. 

58
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,710
i bought out every store in the area
over the last couple of weeks. 

59
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,740
and as lazy parents
become more desperate, 

60
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,150
i will sell them at an enormous profit. 

61
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
isn't that right, princess?

62
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,700
that's the Christmas spirit. 

63
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,190
i am simply punishing those parents

64
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:18,080
that would wait till the last
minute to give their child a gift. 

65
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,960
and such a genetically improbable one. 

66
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,780
look at that. how does that happen?

67
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,500
the king had sex with a unicorn?

68
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,570
a man with a horn had
sex with a royal horse?

69
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,100
yes. oh, hey, is that princess unicorn?

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,380
i thought they were all sold out. 

71
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,100
- they are now. 
- cool. 

72
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,480
my horn can pierce the sky

73
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,460
this is equal parts scotch, absinthe, 

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,900
rum, gin, vermouth, triple sec, 

75
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,420
and two packs of splenda. 

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,060
i call it a one of everything. 

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,950
oh, my god!

78
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,720
- hit me again! 
- all right, 

79
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,400
one more time around the block. 

80
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,740
it will grant you one wish. 

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,360
i wish you would stop rubbing
that lamp in that creepy way. 

82
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,170
stupid--everybody knows
to ask for 100 more wishes. 

83
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,260
dumb. 

84
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:24,510
hey, hey, ange, check it out. 

85
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,070
there's a place in france

86
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,320
where the naked ladies dance

87
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,000
really, Andy?

88
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,220
it's Christmas and you're
singing about nudity and france. 

89
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,050
there's a hole in the wall

90
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:45,180
where the men can see it all

91
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,440
Jim, check that out. 

92
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,460
what is it?

93
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,850
that is vodka, and i mixed
it with orange juice. 

94
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,460
i call it an orange vod-juice-ka. 

95
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,180
- wow, that is delicious. 
- yeah. 

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,930
- i can't believe no one's thought of it. 
- i know!

97
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,750
belly dancing. 

98
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,720
120,180. . . 200. 

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,460
all right. 

100
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,150
ah, thank you so much. 

101
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,600
my daughter is gonna love this. 

102
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,410
- so glad i could help. 
- thanks. 

103
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,750
- merry Christmas. 
- you too. 

104
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,830
fa la la la la la la ka-ching

105
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,630
oh, so this is what
every day would be like

106
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,330
if you hadn't left india. 

107
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:44,270
oh, oh, oh, oh! burnin'. 

108
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,010
make way we got a live one!

109
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,770
on fire!

110
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,380
i'm all right. 

111
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,100
sorry. 

112
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,900
we're back on the fifth. 
should we just do it then?

113
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,170
we cannot do it then. 

114
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,440
monthly dental appointment. 

115
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,640
soft teeth. 

116
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,010
what about february 2nd?

117
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,020
uh. . . would you want to
do it on groundhog day?

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,290
no, no. i celebrate privately. 

119
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,320
that's right. 

120
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,240
um, why don't we just do it now?
we'll do it quickly. 

121
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,850
now? it's our Christmas party. 

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,420
- we'll do it quickly. 
- what if we can't do it quickly?

123
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,090
what if we can't so it quickly?

124
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,940
what if we can't do it?

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,140
do you know how to do an intervention?

126
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,130
hey, shut up. 

127
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,720
here we go. everybody gather up. 

128
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,090
an intervention, 
it's sort of hard to describe. 

129
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,960
but really it's--
it's a coming together--

130
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,150
it's a surprise party. . . for people

131
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,380
who are-- who have addictions. 

132
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,740
and you get in their face
and you scream at them, 

133
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,260
and you make them feel really
badly about themselves. 

134
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,970
and then they stop. 

135
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,790
it looks like we're gonna
be here for a while, 

136
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,280
so why don't you make a little
plate of hummus for everyone?

137
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,870
little triangles of pita
toasted on both sides, 

138
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,390
fanned, so you can easily grab them. 

139
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,160
- i don't--
- and napkins. 

140
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,460
fanned. 

141
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,990
okay. . . how do you feel?

142
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,980
- a little better. 
- i threw up. 

143
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,580
ecch. t. m. i. 

144
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,360
fire girl!

145
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,310
- too soon. 
- yeah. 

146
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:32,020
okay, you know what i thought we should
do is have a quick intervention, 

147
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,460
and then get back to the party. 

148
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,370
Michael, we're only allowed to talk
about meredith's work performance. 

149
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,790
we cannot ask her to stop drinking. 

150
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,680
i am not asking her to stop drinking. 

151
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:43,940
i am imploring her
to quit being an alcoholic. 

152
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,100
i'm not an alcoholic. 

153
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,750
yeah, obviously you are. 

154
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,620
okay, everybody who thinks
that meredith is an alcoholic, 

155
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,020
please raise your hands. 

156
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,110
aye. 

157
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,920
the ayes have it. 

158
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,290
i don't care what everyone thinks. 

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,660
i know i am not an alcoholic. 

160
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,900
all right, well, 

161
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,190
let's look at this a little
bit closer then. shall we?

162
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,090
when i was in college
i used to get wicked hammered. 

163
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,760
my nickname was "puke. "

164
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,960
i would chug a fifth of so-co, 
sneak into a frat party. . . 

165
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,820
polish off a few people's empties. . . 

166
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,900
some brewskis, some jell-o shots. 

167
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,460
do some body shots off myself. 

168
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,070
pass out, wake up the next morning, 

169
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,570
boot, rally, more so-co, head to class. 

170
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,270
probably would have gotten expelled
if i'd let it affect my grades, 

171
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,920
but i aced all my courses. 

172
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,420
they called me "ace. "

173
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,270
it was totally awesome. 
i got straight "b"s. 

174
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,950
they called me "buzz. "

175
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,190
meredith, 

176
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,770
have you ever used alcohol
to alter your mood

177
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,840
or deliberately change
your state of mind?

178
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,300
sure. 

179
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,170
do you sometimes have a drink
to celebrate a special occasion

180
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,450
or mark a holiday?

181
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,900
obviously. 

182
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,020
have you ever, 
under the influence of alcohol, 

183
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,620
questioned the teachings
of the mormon church?

184
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,840
where did you get this?

185
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,070
i got it on a web site. 
that's not important. 

186
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,610
Michael, we should contact some experts. 

187
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,940
she don't know what you're doing. 

188
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,070
you know what, toby, 

189
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,490
one of my employees
is undergoing a crisis. 

190
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,360
and i wish for just once

191
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,200
you would take my side on this. 

192
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,190
i'm doing your job, man. 

193
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,160
hey, are you texting?

194
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,190
yeah, 'cause this is kind of a drag. 

195
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,010
alcohol is a drag. yes. 

196
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,810
here's what i'd like to do. 

197
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,120
i'd like to go around the room

198
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,950
and have us each express to meredith

199
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,230
how her alcoholism has affected us

200
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
i'll begin. 

201
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,740
this Christmas party is perhaps

202
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,850
the best Christmas party
i have ever been to. 

203
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,400
but then you got so drunk
that we had to stop and do this. 

204
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,890
that's how your drinking affected me. 

205
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,890
anybody else?

206
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,420
another time when meredith's drinking

207
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,160
affected you?

208
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:49,970
come on, people. 

209
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,150
if we don't say anything, 
she's not gonna get any better. 

210
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,960
yes, kevin. 

211
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,780
well, meredith, there was that one time

212
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,620
you bought movie tickets, 

213
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,230
and then you got too drunk to go. 

214
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,080
so you gave them to me. 

215
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,150
and that was really cool. 

216
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,400
that's--you didn't--

217
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,540
you weren't hurt by that. 

218
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,870
yeah, you said affected by it. 

219
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,340
thanks again. you're welcome. 

220
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,320
no, that's not what we're going for. 

221
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:16,680
who has a problem with
meredith's drinking?

222
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,110
it has to bother you. 

223
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,810
it bothers me, right?

224
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,000
how does it bother you? Dwight?

225
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,340
don't you have anything?

226
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,180
no. i like meredith. 

227
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,820
actually, i don't care for meredith. 

228
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,980
but i don't believe
in this kind of thing. 

229
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,870
in the schrute family, 

230
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,280
we believe in a
five-fingered intervention. 

231
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,740
awareness, education, control, 

232
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,160
acceptance, and punching. 

233
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,090
who's gonna tell us
the latest dirty joke?

234
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,950
who is going to tell us what
you watched on television last night?

235
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,280
i am fine. 

236
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,540
was john belushi fine?
was bob hope fine?

237
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,250
come here. 

238
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,200
if anything ever happened to you, 

239
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,040
i would be very angry at myself

240
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:00,350
for not doing all that i could do. 

241
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:02,090
i know i drink. 

242
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,690
i like to party. 

243
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,690
i want you to say "i'm an alcoholic. "

244
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:08,110
i'm not an alcoholic!

245
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,930
you can say it as loudly as you want, 

246
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,210
but we're not going to believe you. 

247
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,260
i was waiting until later to hand out

248
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,600
this year's gifts from corporate. 

249
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,300
i don't think
they're appropriate anymore. 

250
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,390
please stop making me do these things. 

251
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,430
oh, sorry, it's your job. 

252
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,650
it's the season of mercy. 

253
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,180
you never showed me mercy
when you were in charge. 

254
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,480
why aren't you wearing the hair net?

255
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,500
i lost it. 

256
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,240
fine. 

257
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,800
okay. 

258
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,540
nice. 

259
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:58,070
i don't mind telling you
that i have an addiction. 

260
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:01,250
i do. . . to porn. 

261
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,520
all right. no, no, no. no. 

262
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,230
that is--the image, 

263
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:08,250
i think we all can agree, 
is very disgusting. 

264
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,280
but you know what, meredith, 

265
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:14,300
you lit your hair on fire today. 

266
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,550
what about tomorrow?

267
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,780
what is going to happen

268
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,790
when you come in to work
and you're dead?

269
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:22,260
i stab her in the brain
with a wooden stick. 

270
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,370
there are several ways
to kill a zombie. 

271
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,960
but the most satisfying one

272
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,390
is to stab it in the brain
with a wooden stick. 

273
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,710
everyone in this room loves you. 

274
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:32,500
but mark my words, 

275
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,070
we are not going to support
your alcoholism anymore. 

276
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,540
the next time you light
yourself on fire, 

277
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,420
we are not going to help put you out. 

278
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,640
oh, as fire marshal, i would have to. 

279
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,210
Dwight--

280
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,450
she is a hazard to the other
people of the office. 

281
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,950
oh, okay. 

282
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,980
i suppose i could do it
if it was a controlled burn

283
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,670
in a well-ventilated area. 

284
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,480
yeah, but you're gonna
need a permit for that. 

285
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,440
oh, right, that'll take a couple of weeks. 

286
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,090
- i can get you one in an hour. 
- really?

287
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,570
okay, you know, this-- this is over. 

288
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,560
i agree. 

289
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,310
Michael, i think you did
the best you could, 

290
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:04,110
but this is bigger than all of us. 

291
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,410
enabler. 

292
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,560
enabler. enabler. 

293
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,200
enabler. enabler. enabler. 

294
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:11,620
it's Christmas, 
and we are turning our back

295
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,130
on somebody who's asking for help. 

296
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,440
you know what the only thing
i want for Christmas?

297
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,150
i want meredith to get better. 

298
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,880
that's my only wish. 

299
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:21,640
but you know what, 
my wishes never come true. 

300
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,660
so i'm not going to wish that on her. 

301
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,110
**

302
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,580
they've been in there for 45 minutes. 

303
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,750
i know. 

304
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,220
if she wasn't an
alcoholic before, she is now. 

305
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:41,450
that's a halwa shebakia cookie. 
they serve it during ramadan. 

306
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,170
it's great. 

307
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,640
hey. 

308
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,050
- what's up?
- you take requests?

309
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,450
- sure. 
- please stop. 

310
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,470
because we're having
a Christmas party. 

311
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,510
i'll be down in a minute. 

312
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,050
could you write down the number

313
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,740
of that rehabilitation center
that you mentioned?

314
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,930
sure. wow. 

315
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,310
ow. 

316
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,650
we just missed poor richard's. 

317
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,870
- we did?
- yeah, i thought we were

318
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,660
-going out for a drink. 
- oh, shoot. 

319
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,320
oh, well, we'll have to go
someplace else then, i guess. 

320
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,420
- well, the bog? 
- yeah. . . 

321
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,840
- cooper's, Kelly's. . . 
- we could go there, sure. 

322
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,770
- brixx's, carmen's. . . 
- yes. 

323
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,210
- the fort, Andy gavin's?
-i have a new place. 

324
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,280
it must have just opened up. 

325
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,250
it--yeah. recently. 

326
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,800
yeah. all right. all right. 

327
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,490
enough of this Christmas crap. 

328
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,030
let's get some party music. yeah!

329
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,010
yeah. oh, there you go. 

330
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,610
yeah! that's good. 

331
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,760
yeah, that's better. 

332
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,420
we're party girls. 

333
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,770
hey, sasha, it's daddy. 

334
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:30,000
have you ever heard of
this doll, princess unicorn?

335
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,960
no, no, no. 

336
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,930
no, i'm just curious if you heard of it. 

337
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,550
this is great. 

338
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,140
my ex-wife's gonna be so pissed. 

339
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,430
for once, daddy's gonna be a hero. 

340
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,720
- 200? 
- yo. 

341
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,230
hey, i'd like to buy one of your dolls. 

342
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,660
oh, that's my last one. 

343
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,410
oh, no. i--

344
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:59,720
no, no, i was gonna--
i was gonna buy that doll. 

345
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,020
thanks, man. 

346
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,620
i was gonna get the doll. 

347
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,240
i was--

348

i need you to put
the Christmas tree back up. 

403
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,670
it's outside. 

404
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,690
i didn't ask you where it was. 
i told you where it needs to be. 

405
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,490
shut up. 

406
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,090
excuse me?

407
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,970
i'm not moving the tree. 

408
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,270
face it, the only power
you have over me

409
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,040
is this little secret that
i know you're not gonna tell. 

410
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,990
oh, and you wanna know how i know that?

411
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:29,060
because then you won't be able to plan

412
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,490
your stupid, tacky parties anymore. 

413
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:33,250
so you move the tree. 

414
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,200
okay. 

415
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,830
Angela's having sex with Dwight. 

416
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:57,980
i caught them doing it after
toby's going away party. 

417
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,920
well, don't look so surprised. 

418
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,420
- i knew it. 
- you did not know it. 

419
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,400
i knew some of it. 

420
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,920
everyone knew some of it. 

421
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,820
it's Christmas. 

422
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,520
you knew it. 

423
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,030
thank you. 

424
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,890
- i knew it. 
- she knew it. 

425
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,050
as it turns out, you can't just

426
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,050
check someone into rehab
against their will. 

427
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,990
they have to do it voluntarily. 

428
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,100
and they have to hit rock bottom. 

429
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,690
so i think i know what
i need to do at this point. 

430
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,950
i need to find ways to push
meredith to the bottom. 

431
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:39,300
um, i think i can do it. 

432
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,370

433
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,150

still here--perfect.
