00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,000
Pam, line three.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,600
Okay, thanks.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,200
New york, as it turns out,
is very expensive.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,200
And i ran out
of money.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,600
I thought about selling
a kidney,

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:19,000
But michael offered to get me
a part-Time job at corporate.

7
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:21,900
Hey.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:27,500
* pamela-A-A *

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,600
Of course,

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,900
Now michael knows where to reach me
16 to 18 hours a week.

11
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,800
Hey, michael.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,800
* pamela-A-A *

13
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,900
<i>Miss, you, kiddo.</i>

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,300
<i>Miss you...so much.</i>

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,400
- Hey.
- Hello.

19
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,300
That was really fun
last night.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,300
Yeah, it was nice.

21
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,100
I'm actually thinking about getting
my own set of put-Put golf clubs.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,700
Oh, that would be great.
You need that.

23
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,700
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, it would help.

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,200
Well, i, uh...

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
- I let her win.
- No, he didn't.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
So...

28
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,100
When, um,
can i see you again?

29
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,800
Um, tonight.
I'm free tonight.

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
Is that too eager?

31
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,500
No.

32
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,100
I don't care.
I'm free tonight.

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,300
Okay.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,100
Oh, wait.

35
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, tonight's no good.

36
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,600
Because i am busy
taking you out.

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,100
Oh, i just remembered.
I can't tonight.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Why?

39
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,300
I'm going out with you.

40
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,500
Wow.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,100
Oh, wait a second.

42
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,800
Oh, i can't tonight.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
- Tonight's--
- No more.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
- No more.
- All right.

45
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,100
Too many times.

46
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
It's all good.

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,100
Um, all right,
so good.

48
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,700
So have a nice day.

49
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,500
Thank you.
You too.

50
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,300
You're welcome.

51
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,600
In my opinion,

52
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,200
the third date is traditionally
the one where...

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,500
You have sex.

54
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
Does holly feel that way?

55
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,400
I don't know.

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,600
I will probably find out
tonight.

57
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,100
If she starts having sex
with me,

58
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,500
I'll know for sure.

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,100
That's for you.

60
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,400
And, uh, oh.

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,500
I am right in assuming that
Dwight is short for d-Money.

62
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,100
'Cause that's what i wrote
on your save-The-Date.

63
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,500
You set a date?

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,900
<i>J-Money.</i>

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,200
<i>Or should it be t-Money,
for tuna?</i>

66
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,700
<i>Receptionist-Money.</i>

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,500
<i>K-Money.</i>

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,300
What are you making?

69
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,400
A knife.

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,200
You're making a knife
with a knife?

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,300
You got a better way?

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,200
You wanna talk about it?

73
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,200
About what?

74
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,500
You know I know.

75
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
You know they know.

76
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,200
I know none of that.

77
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,000
And if i did,
you'd be the last to know.

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,600
Oh, the mall could be fun.

79
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

80
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,400
We could go to the food court,
get different foods.

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,900
You could get
chicken teriyaki.

82
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,000
I could get a hot dog.

83
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,400
Some of what we order depends on
whether we're having sex after.

84
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,400
Oh, my!

85
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Wow, elephant in the room.

86
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,100
Are we, do you think?

87
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Do you think
we're gonna have sex tonight?

88
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,200
Hell, yeah.

89
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,900
Okay, so we do
the restaurant thing,

90
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,300
And then--Then--
Then we can do--

91
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,900
We'll just do
the restaurant thing first.

92
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,300
Yeah, that's good.

93
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Probably get soup
or something light.

94
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,700
Hi.

95
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
She introduced me
to so many things.

96
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,200
Pasteurized milk, sheets,
Monotheism...

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,300
Presents on your birthday,

98
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,800
Preventative medicine.

99
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,300
It's nice to learn
new things.

100
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,400
- I was talking to myself.
- Okay.

101
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,900
I just don't get it.

102
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,500
What don't you get?

103
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,400
Why is she marrying Andy?

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,700
Angela's not really
a risk taker.

105
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,700
And Andy's not really a risk.

106
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,600
That's really fattening.

107
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,800
No, it's lettuce.

108
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,900
- It's time to go?
- No.

109
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
No.

110
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,300
Reservations are at 8:00,

111
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,300
So we've got, like,
an hour 45 minutes.

112
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,100
I'm a crazy 8.
I'm crazy.

113
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,900
You're crazy.
Go crazy.

114
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
Oh, I forgot my keys.

115
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,300
Do you need 'em?

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,900
- Yeah,let's go grab them.
- All right.

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
<i>Oh, after vous.</i>

118
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,600
<i>Thank vous.</i>

119
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,400
What?

120
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh!

121
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,100
<i>I didn't forget my keys.</i>

122
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,300
<i>I just didn't want
to make out with you</i>

123
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,700
<i>In front of the cameras.</i>

124
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,600
<i>Do you think they can hear us?</i>

125
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,000
<i>Not if we turn these dials</i>

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,800
<i>All the way down.</i>

127
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
<i>Now they can't hear us
at all.</i>

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,700
<i>Oh, good.</i>

129
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,600
<i>We're totally alone.</i>

130
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,600
<i>Yes, that's correct.</i>

131
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,800
<i>I need to cancel checks
from 10,001 to 90,000.</i>

132
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
Great, they stole
my laptop.

133
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,500
Yeah, well, they stole
my surge protector.

134
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,800
How does that even compare?

135
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,600
Oscar, i'm now going
to be prone to surges.

136
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,300
Oh, my god.
What happened?

137
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,500
We were robbed last night.

138
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,700
Bravo, Watson.

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,800
Looks like a classic
seven-Man job.

140
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Okay, security tapes
were stolen.

141
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>Motives--Financial,</i><i>Or possibly
vintage HP computer collectors.</i>

142
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Hank down at security
had clocked out.

143
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,800
And that is all we have.

144
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,400
Can i talk to you
for a second?

145
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,200
Yeah.

146
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,900
Oh--Oh!

147
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,800
That wasn't us, right?

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,700
You remembered to lock
the doors?

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,000
No, did you?

150
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Michael, I think this
is our fault.

151
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
- Oh, no.My god.
- No,no  

152
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,400
Oh, my god!

153
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,700
So much for sex
without consequences.

154
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>You are such a dork!</i>

155
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,100
<i>Shots!</i>

156
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,600
So apparently Pam went out
last night

157
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,600
And accidentally called my work phone
at 3:00 in the morning.

158
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,900
So...

159
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:56,800
<i>I'm not drunk.</i>

160
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,100
I'm on minute six
of this message.

161
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,800
<i>Okay, i do not sound
like that.</i>

162
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,200
<i>You can take the girl
out of philly...</i>

163
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,100
<i>Scranton.</i>

164
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
The future mother
of my children.

165
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,100
I never felt safe here.

166
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
You're always safe with me.

167
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,200
I'm a very good screamer.

168
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:15,300
And one day,

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,800
We're gonna move to disney's
celebration village in florida

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,900
And leave all of this behind.

171
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
I would very much
like that.

172
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

173
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
* CONSIDER YOURSELF *

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
* AT HOME *

175
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,300
Ugh.

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ugh

177
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Get in.

178
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,600
Where are we going?

179
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,700
I know she loves me,
phyllis.

180
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,100
I am sure of it.

181
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
She practically told me so.

182
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,500
Then you need to give her
an ultimatum.

183
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
Tell her
she needs to make a choice.

184
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,000
You or Andy.

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,700
If she picks you, great.

186
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,300
If not, you can move on.

187
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,000
Are you sure
that's gonna work?

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,900
It did when Bob said
I had to stop talking

189
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,400
to my sister on the phone
so much.

190
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,100
Wait--This isn't our floor.

191
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,800
Dwight.

192
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
How's everyone doing?

193
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,100
<i>My door is always open</i>

194
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,500
<i>If anyone wants to talk.</i>

195
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,600
I don't want to talk.

196
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,100
I want my laptop back.

197
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,600
Nobody steals from Creed Bratton
and gets away with it.

198
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,300
The last person to do this
disappeared.

199
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,600
His name?

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,400
Creed Bratton.

201
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,500
We're gonna make everything
all right.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
All right?

203
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Conference room,15 minutes.

204
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
1/2 hour.

205
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,500
All right?

206
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,700
To recoup their losses,

207
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,700
I am planning
a little charity auction.

208
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,900
Where people from all over
scranton can come

209
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,900
And bid on our goods
and services.

210
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,400
I'm calling it crime-Aid.

211
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,900
It's like farm aid.

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,400
But instead of farms fighting
against aids,

213
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,700
It is us fighting
against our own poverty

214
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,600
I think it's a fun idea.

215
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,300
Thank you.

216
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,700
We could auction off things
that we do for each other,

217
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,000
Like cleaning
or tennis lessons.

218
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,400
My sorority did it
all the time.

219
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,100
Okay, i'm gonna have to
stop you right there.

220
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,700
Was this a sorority that you
didn't get into a real sorority

221
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,700
So you had to kind
of form your own?

222
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,400
<i>- Move on, michael.
- Okay.</i>

223
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,100
Okay, well, come on!

224
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,500
Let's have an auction.
Let's do this.

225
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,300
We'll auction off people,

226
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,800
Like in the olden days.

227
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,600
<i>So in order to recoup</i>
the value of items we liked,

228
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,300
We have to spend more money
on things we don't want.

229
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,000
Who would ever come to this?

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,900
<i>I don't know.</i>

231
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,600
It could be any number
of people.

232
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,900
It could be a pedestrian.

233
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,100
It could be a old person.

234
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,800
It could be a lookie-Loo.

235
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,900
<i>Or it could be</i>

236
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,800
A bruce springsteen fan--
What?

237
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,600
Who said that?
I did.

238
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
Why did i say that?

239
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,700
<i>Oh, i think you know why
i said that.</i>

240
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,500
<i>I think it is very apparent.</i>

241
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,400
I think it goes without saying.

242
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,000
Bear with me.

243
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,100
<i>There's a point there.</i>

244
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,300
<i>But what is the point?</i>

245
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,000
<i>I don't understand
what he's saying.</i>

246
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,300
It seems a little shady.

247
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,600
It seems a little foggy.

248
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,600
Well,it's not a little foggy.

249
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
<i>There's really something
going on here--</i>

250
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,400
Do you need us
for any of this?

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
Do I?

252
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,800
Michael scored
the big ticket item.

253
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,300
Springsteen tickets.

254
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,800
The boss scored the boss.

255
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,100
Yeah, i think
that's pretty boss.

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,500
He knows how to get things.

257
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
He got me.

258
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Whoa!

259
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,900
Sorry.

260
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,300
Twice.

261
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,200
- Right?
- Mm-Hmm.

262
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,200
Listen to me close,

263
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,700
'Cause i'm only
gonna say this once.

264
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,700
You either break off your engagement
with that singing buffoon,

265
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,600
apologize,and then date me.

266
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,800
Or you can say good-Bye
to this.

267
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,500
I think you have me confused
with another person.

268
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,400
I said i was only
gonna say it once.

269
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,700
You have until 6:14 p.M.

270
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
6:14.

271
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,600
<i>I heard you.</i>

272
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,100
Pump it up!
Yeah!

273
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,400
Yeah! Yeah!

274
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,400
Pump up the volume.

275
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,200
Thank you very much,
everybody.

276
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,400
Thank you,Mr.Springsteen.

277
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
And welcome
to C.R.I.M.E.-A.I.D.

278
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,200
Crime reduces innocence.
Makes everyone angry,I declare.

279
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It is not known

280
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,100
How many office robberies occur
<i>Every second</i>

281
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,700
<i>Because there is no wikipedia entry</i>
for office robbery statistics.

282
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,600
<i>However, tonight,
its victims</i>

283
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,800
Are standing together
and standing strong

284
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
In the form of song,

285
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,300
<i>Cooking lessons,</i>

286
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,000
<i>And hugs.</i>

287
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,500
Really, phyllis?
You're auctioning a hug?

288
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,900
<i>Okay, so with no further ado,</i>

289
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,800
Lights, camera, auction!

290
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,500
Take it away,Bruce!

291
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,200
Mike gave me a list of
his top ten springsteen songs.

292
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,500
Three of them were
huey lewis and the news.

293
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>One was tracy chapman,
fast car.</i>

294
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,600
And my personal favorite,

295
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,900
<i>Short people.</i>

296
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,500
Okay, this is the moment
that you have all been waiting for.

297
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,400
Our first item
up for bids tonight

298
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,200
Is something I consider
to be very boss indeed.

299
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,700
It is a yoga lesson
from Holly Flax!

300
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,300
<i>Yoga!</i>

301
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,900
<i>And I would like
to start the bidding off</i>

302
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,500
At $300.

303
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,800
$300, do i hear $300?

304
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
<i>$300.</i>

305
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Hey, batter, batter.
Hey, batter.

306
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,500
Swing, batter, $300,
$300, $300.

307
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,700
<i>Anybody, $300.</i>

308
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,600
$400.

309
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Do I see somebody in the back?

310
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,600
<i>Is there somebody in the back?</i>

311
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
<i>Do i see somebody in the back?</i>

312
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,300
<i>400--$450.</i>

313
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,000
Sold for $300 to me!

314
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,400
What the hell is that?

315
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,200
It's the only gavel
I could find.

316
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,300
It squeaks when you bang it.
That's what she said.

317
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,600
<i>Let's hear it for me!</i>

318
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,900
Right?

319
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
A bargain at any price.

320
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>Hey, mike, do my thing.</i>

321
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Oh, yes, great.
Very good.

322
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,100
Um, so, Darryl and the boys
in the hood in the warehouse 

323
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
<i>Have graciously donated</i>
to,uh,go out

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,400
for a beer with them right now.

325
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,700
You know what?

326
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,400
I'm actually going to
bid on this.

327
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,600
I'm gonna start the bidding,

328
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,400
Because this is something
that I've dreamt of.

329
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,700
Mike, you can't do that.

330
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,100
It's conflict of interest.

331
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,300
$5.

332
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,900
Sold to Jim!

333
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,900

Well,this next item is sure

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,100
<i>If you don't win it.</i>

00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,100
It just says creed.

338
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,600
Yeah, that's all-Inclusive.

339
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,600
She thought I was mcnabb.

340
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,700
I can see that.

341
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,700
Yeah, well,

00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,500

I'm not gonna hit you
or anything.

00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh, i wouldn't--

- I'm good, yeah.
- Okay.

351
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,600
<i>Hey, Darryl,

Fine.

361
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Okay, all right.

362
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey, you know what?

363
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,900
I would appreciate it if people would
stop storming off the stage.

364
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
We are getting there,folks.

365
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,300
Slow and steady.

366
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
<i>Well,well,
have we been blessed today.</i>

367
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,700

371
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,000
<i>I'd like to auction off</i> a weekend

Hey, phyllis.

379
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
Someone let the air
out of your tires.

380
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,800
Come quick.

381
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,500
Oh, dear.

382
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,000
<i>Keep it going.
Hey, batter, batter--</i>

160

385
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,300
<i>I had to get your attention.</i>

386
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,800
This is an emergency.

387
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,100
Why couldn't you
have just said it?

388
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Why did you actually do it?

389
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,600
Listen, she ignored
my ultimatum.

390
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Now what?

391
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,900
Now you move on.

392
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,200
Okay, fine.
I've moved on.

393
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
Now how do i get her back?

394
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Well, Dwight,
I don't think you do.

395
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,500
I think you've got
your answer.

396
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,500
Wait, that's it?

397
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,800
That's your advice?

398
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,300
I thought you had some kind
of big master plan.

399
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,500
Well,I just think
we all deserve to be

400
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,600
with someone
who wants to be with us.

401
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Oh.

402
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,000
I get it.

403
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,700
You're trying to secure your place as
head of the party-Planning committee.

404
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,700
You're just being selfish.

405
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,300
And you slap like a girl.

406
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
What did Phyllis do wrong?

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,500
I'll tell you
what Phyllis did wrong.

408
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,400
She stuck her nose
into my business

409
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,800
And tried to help me.

410
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
What's going on with Pam?

411
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,500
- Oh, she's good,actually.
- Yeah?

412
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,100
She's, um,
she's in new york.

413
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,200
She's at art school.

414
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:54,500
Really?

415
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,900
Yeah, she's doing
really well.

416
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Huh.

417
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,100
She's engaged, um...

418
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,800
To me.

419
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,900
Congrats, man.

420
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,600
Oh, thanks, man.

421
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,100
Appreciate that.

422
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,400
So pam's happy?

423
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,700
Yeah, i'd say
she's happy.

424
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,300
I mean,
she loves her classes.

425
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,900
Loves the city.

426
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,200
Last night, she was out
with her friends

427
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,400
Till, like, 8:00 a.M.

428
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,100
Wow.

429
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,800
What?

430
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I thought you were
a friend.

431
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
I am going to see pam

432
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,200
Because I feel like
I should.

433
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,900
When are you getting
to Bruce?

434
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,300
Uh,just a few more items.

435
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,900
Bruce, bruce, bruce.

436
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,800
Bruce, bruce, bruce!

437
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,300
<i>All right, all right,
all right!</i>

438
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,400
Here we go, here we go.

439
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,200
All right, big ticket item.

440
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,600
All right, in my pocket,

441
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
I have...

442
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,900
Two tickets...

443
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,400
To Mr. Bruce springsteen,
front...

444
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Oh, where are those?

445
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,600
<i>Has anyone seen</i>

446
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,500
<i>An envelope with Bruce Springsteen</i>
<i>Front row tickets</i>

447
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,500
And backstage passes?

448
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,800
Anybody seen something like--
Laying around?

449
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,400
Do you want us
to look for 'em?

450
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,000
No.

451
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
I think they were stolen.

452
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,600
I think they were stolen

453
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
And they're gone forever.

454
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,400
<i>So...</i>

455
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:33,000
<i>Oh, that was
the last good item.</i>

456
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,600
<i>So good job,everybody.</i>

457
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,700
I have my hug.

458
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,300
Yeah, well, phyllis,

459
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,900
Nobody...really wants a hug,
so.

460
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,400
I'll bid on a hug.

461
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,700
She's your wife,
you idiot.

462
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,100

463
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,300

464
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
Uh, what the hell
is happening?

465
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,100
250.

466
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
What are you doing?

467
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,500
I need a hug, unless
you're gonna give me one.

468
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,000
- Not here.

You know what?
No.

495
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,500
Because...
I'm not that guy.

496
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,400
And we are not
that couple.

497
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,800
Hey, that looks good.

498
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,900
Listen, about the tickets.

499
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,600
It's sort of a gray--

500
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Kind of a gray area

501
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,500
In terms of whether
i had them--

502
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,400
The springsteen tickets seemed
too good to be true.

503
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,900
But a lot of michael seems
too good to be true.

504
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,100
So far it's all true.

505
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,600
But yeah, those tickets

506
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,700
Really seemed too good
to be true.

507
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,400
No, I did not know
that michael was dating holly.
