6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,000
I was there and that dudes are not engaged. 

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm not a big believer in therapy but 

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,400
???

9
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:24,900

Double wedding,me Angela,you and Holly

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,700
No. We would never do that. 

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,600
And we did it would be with Jim and Pam.

13
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,700
Yeah. We would never do that. 

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:32,600
Yeah,so there you go

18
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,600
so I picked white

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,100
Oh. Michael did you tell your mom yet?

20
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,200
No

21
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,400
- No,Not yet
- Why not, why not?

22
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,300

23
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,100

00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,300
All right. I'll call her.

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
She is going to freak out

31
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
- Speakerphone
- Not...

32
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:03,500
Hello

33
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,100
Mom. I'm getting married.

34
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,300
No, you're not...

35
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,000
Why do you always do that?

36
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,700
Whenever I'm getting married,

37
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,000
you don't believe me.

38
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,300
Are you getting married?

39
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,700
No

40
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,200
- Are you...?
- I'm not

41
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,600
I'm not getting married

42
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,800
Psych

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,200
So I returned
my bridesmaid dress,

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,000
And it was on sale,
So I'm out $100.

48
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,500
And i'm out a fiancee.

49
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,900
- Those are customer surveys?
- Yeah.

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
Um, this is all of them.

51
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,300
Jim, Dwight, Phyllis,
Stanley, Andy...

52
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,600
And, oh...

53
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,900
Oh, it's the receipt
to my bridesmaid dress.

54
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:12,900
What's that doing there?

55
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,500
I'll take care of
that for you.

56
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,800
Thanks.

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Kelly kapoor

58
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Is our dusky, exotic
customer service rep.

59
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,400
And once a year
she will contact our clients

60
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,500
And find out how happy they are
with our salespeople.

61
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,200
Sort of a kapoor's list.

62
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,100
<i>Schindler's list parody.</i>

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,300
That's not appropriate.
No.

64
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,900
Those reports affect
our bonuses.

65
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,600
Which is kind of
great for me

66
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
because,You wouldn't know
from looking at her,

67
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
But pam's a gold digger.

68
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,700
<i>Hey, new york ain't free.</i>

69
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,100
<i>Now get back to work.</i>

70
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,700
Ah.

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,100
It's the world's
tiniest bluetooth.

72
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,100
I found it in a japanese
gadget store in the village.

73
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,800
I got one for jim too.

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
Jim, say something.

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,800
<i>Testing, testing.
Hello, everybody.</i>

76
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,300
We wanted to stay
on the phone all day,

77
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,500
But the company has a policy
against Eight-Hour personal calls.

78
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,000
So we're not telling anyone.

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,500
Uh,Pam,What do you want
in your coffee?

80
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,900
Sprinkle of cinnamon.

81
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,100
I should go.

82
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,200
All righty, Dwighty,
let's see how you did.

83
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,900
- Bring it on.
- Nooo...

84
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,000
Sorry

85
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,300
- Wow.
- What does it say?

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
Dwight, your feedback
is horrible.

87
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
That's impossible.

88
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,800
A number of your clients
found your personal style

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
Abrasive and distasteful?

90
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,100
- I sell more paper than anyone.
- No, no, no, no, no.

91
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,600
Wait, is this a joke?

92
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm getting that queasy feeling
that sometimes accompanies jokes.

93
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
Do I look like
i am joking?

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,800
No, but that's
sometimes part of it.

95
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,900
If i were joking,
you'd be laughing.

96
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,400
Do you look like
you are laughing?

97
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,900
Impossible to say.
I can't see myself.

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You're not.

99
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,900
Yo, tommy tuna,

100
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,200
- Did you get your scores yet?
- Nope.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,800
I got mine.
They were really good.

102
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I miss him.

103
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,300
You must be really proud.

104
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah, pretty psyched.
Whoa!

105
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,500
That's my mug.

106
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,700
Oh...sorry.

107
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,300
It was just--
It was right here.

108
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,900
Right, well,
It's mine, so,

109
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,500
If you could pour it out
and get another one.

110
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,800
Okay.

111
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Or maybe i could
finish the coffee in here,

112
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,200
And you can use...

113
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,100
Oh, snoopy.
He's funny.

114
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,200
Don't give up snoopy.
That's mine.

115
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,900
That is a great mug.

116
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,000
But it's not my mug.
That is my mug.

117
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,700
So...give it back.

118
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
How can you even be sure?

119
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
It has my face on it.

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Make the face.

121
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,800
No, i don't see it.

122
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,700
Dude, that is my face.

123
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
<i>What was that?</i>

124
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
Wow.
That was Dwight.

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,000
He seems upset
about something.

126
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,300
Describe him exactly.

127
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,900
What color mustard
is his shirt?

128
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,100
Yellow or dijon?

129
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,800
It is more of
a spicy brown, actually.

130
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you
mumbling about?

131
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,300
How was your meeting
with michael?

132
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,500
None of your business.

133
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,300
Was it your scores?

134
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,000
Those can't be
my scores, jim.

135
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,000
- For your information...
- mm-Hmm.

136
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,700
I'm being sabotaged.

137
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,500
Of course.

138
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,700
And i'm gonna find that person
and punish them.

139
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,500
Absolutely.

140
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,200
Or you could just be nice
to your customers.

141
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,900
- You're an idiot.
- There's the charm.

142
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,300
Jimbo, let's do this thing.

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,100
That is me.
Wish me luck.

144
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,400
<i>- No way.
- Good luck.</i>

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,000
Thanks.
I didn't say anything.

146
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,600
<i>- I love you.
- I love you too.</i>

147
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,500
What do you think
i am saying to you?!

148
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Not talking to you.

149
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,400
I've caught Jim talking to himself
several times today.

150
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,600
What a loser.

151
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,800
Get a friend, loser!

152
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,900
Yeah, i'm looking at it
right now.

153
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
It's really gorgeous.

154
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
You guys do great work.

155
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,000
I found the best "tentist"
on the east coast.

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,500
He personally tented giuliani's
first and third weddings.

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
And I got him.

158
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,100
I got him!

159
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,300
Would you be able to do
the same design,

160
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,100
<i>But with walls of gray?</i>

161
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
<i>And a top that's gray too?</i>

162
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,800
<i>Fabulous.</i>

163
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,300
Oh, come on.

164
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
<i>- What?
- You too?</i>

165
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,200
Did my scores drop
a little?

166
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,100
Jim, they are a poopy.

167
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Jim?

168
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Jim?

169
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,600
Are we even sure
that's my file?

170
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,000
No.

171
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Yes,I am sure, Jim.
It--

172
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,500
Well, there's gotta be
an explanation.

173
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,400
- I agree.
- Yeah.

174
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,900
So let's see what
we can find out from reading.

175
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,200
"Jim halpert is smudge
and arrogant."

176
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,700
I think you mean "smug."

177
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
- Arrogance.
- Michael, i'm just trying to--

178
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,500
And there's our smudgeness.

179
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,700
I need a decent bonus

180
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Because I'm actually in the process
of buying my parents' house...

181
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
So that they can retire.

182
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,800
And if history
tells us anything,

183
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,600
It's that you can't go wrong
buying a house you can't afford.

184
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,300
Pam doesn't know
about the house, so...

185
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,500
Fun surprise.

186
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,700
Pam.
Sorry about that.

187
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,200
I lost you for a second.

188
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,000
So as it turns out,


189
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,900
I may not have done so hot
on my customer reviews this year.

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,200
Maybe it's because
you spent the whole year

191
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
Flirting
with the receptionist.

192
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,900
A little bit.

193
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,300
Worth it.

194
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Here's what's going to happen.

195
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,900
I am going to have
to fix you.

196
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:17,300
Manage you two
on a more personal scale.

197
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,300
A--A more micro form
of management.

198
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,300
Jim, what is that called?

199
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,200
- Microgement.
- Boom. Yes!

200
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
Now, jim is going to be
the client.

201
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,600
Dwight, you're going
to have to sell to him

202
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,400
Without being aggressive,
hostile, or difficult.

203
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,900
- Let's go.
- All right, fine.

204
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,900
Bbbrrrrring.
Bbrriing.

205
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,300
Hello.

206
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,100
Hello,this is Dwight Schrute from
the Dunder Mifflin paper company.

207
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,800
Wow, that's great
'cause i need paper.

208
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,400
Excellent, then you are
in luck

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,900
Because we are having a limited-Time
offer only on everything.

210
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,200
Wow, this is
my lucky day.

211
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,100
Ask him his name.

212
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,300
What is your name, sir?

213
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,700
I am Bill Buttlicker.

214
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,500
Really?
That's your real name?

215
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
How dare you?

216
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,200
My family built this country,
by the way!

217
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
Be respectful,Dwight.
Please

218
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,100
Yes, Michael.

219
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,700
Would you hold on
one second?

220
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
- That's my other line.
- What?

221
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
- No--But i--
- Hello.

222
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,100
Yeah.

223
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,000
No, i'm just on the phone
with this stupid salesman.

224
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,300
He's so dumb.

225
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,600
I'm probably just gonna keep him
on the line forever

226
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,900
And not buy anything.

227
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Yeah, okay.

228
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
It's up to you
to change his mind.

229
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,300
Sorry.

230
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,200
That was
a family emergency.

231
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,500
Oh, no.
What's wrong?

232
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,100
You know what,
that's private.

233
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,700
Boundaries, dwight.
Come on!

234
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
I'm sorry,
mr. Buttlicker.

235
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,400
As i was saying,

236
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
- we're having a limited--
- Sorry,you're gonna have to speak up 

237
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,200
a little bit louder.

238
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm hard of hearing.

239
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,200
He's hard of--
He's an old man, let's go.

240
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,000
Okay, as i was saying,
right now 

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,100
- We are having--
- You're gonna have to talk louder.

242
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,000
Okay, our prices
have never been lower.

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Son, you have
to talk louder.

244
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,100
- Never been lower.
- Louder, son!

245
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,000
Buttlicker, our prices
have never been lower!

246
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,500
- OK!Stop it!
- He--

247
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,500
That is totally inappropriate.

248
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,300
You never yell
at the client.

249
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,000
<i>- You never yell at the client.
- Now, you listen to me,sir.</i>

250
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,800
Here we go.

251
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,900
The three words
I would describe you as

252
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,300
Is aggressive, hostile,
and definitely difficult.

253
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,900
- Please, mr. Buttlicker.
- I'm irate right now!

254
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,700
- Give me the phone.
- Please give me another chance.

255
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,200
- Give me the phone.Give me the phone.
- Mr. Buttlicker--

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,600
I have to put you on
with my boss.

257
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,900
Well,I should hope so.

258
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,700
Who is this?

259
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,100
Hello, this is Michael Scott,
regional manager.

260
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,300
Well, this is
William m. Buttlicker.

261
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,500
Hello, mr. Buttlicker.
How may we help you?

262
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,700
Michael,I like the sound
of your voice.

263
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,700
You know
what i'm gonna do?

264
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,500
I'm gonna buy $1 million
worth of paper products today.

265
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,600
Yeah!

266
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,600
See how it's done?

267
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,900
Thank you very much, sir.

268
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
I don't think you'll regret it.

269
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,700
- See what i did?
- You are the master.

270
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,300
- There is one condition,Michael.
- Yes?

271
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,800
You have to fire the salesman
that treated me so terribly.

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,900
Don't do it,Michael.

273
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
It's a million-Dollar sale.

274
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,100
So it's called
the shangri-La tent.

275
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,400
It's two stories,
heated,

276
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
<i>And it has a bridal suite
for my bridalal sweet.</i>

277
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,700
It's just really simple.
Really tasteful.

278
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,900
I don't want to be married
in a tent like a hobo.

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
Hobos live in trains.

280
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,900
Nana Mimi can't be
in canvas that long.

281
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,800
Well,Nana...
Mim--

282
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,100
Okay, look...

283
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,700
This tent is awesome.

284
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
And it's in high demand,

285
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,200
so i really think
We should put a deposit down now.

286
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,300
Okay, fine.

287
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,600
You can have your tent,

288
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,100
But only if it's
in a field.

289
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,800
A hand-Plowed field.

290
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
Done, and done-Er.

291
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
There has to be a barn
that's old enough

292
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,200
That you can see the stars
through the roof slats

293
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,800
When you lay on your back.

294
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,900
And antique tools to look at
when you roll over.

295
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Do you have a specific place
in mind?

296
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,600
No.

297
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,900
But anything within a five to
eight-Mile radius is acceptable.

298
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,000
On it!

299
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,300
Dwight.

300
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,800
Dwight

301
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Get in.

302
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,100
- Are you serious?
- Get in!

303
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
- Okay,what are you--
- Shh!

304
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,200
- They might be listening to us.
- What's that?

305
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
- They might be listening to us!
- Who's "they"?

306
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,100
Customer service might be
monitoring this conversation.

307
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,800
In this car?

308
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,900
You never know.
Better safe than sorry.

309
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,200
What are you thinking of?

310
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Who stands to benefit
from our downfall?

311
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,700
The mob?
Maybe NASA.

312
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,400
Could be the mob.

313
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,000
But then Dunder Mifflin would need to
be a front for money laundering,

314
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,600
And there's little evidence
of that.

315
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,800
<i>Is there some evidence?</i>

316
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,100
<i>Ooh, cute shoes online.</i>

317
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,600
How many shoes
do you need?

318
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,700
I don't know.
Two?

319
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,300
Maybe three,
if one wears out.

320
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
How many shoes
do you need?

321
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,600
I'm not talking to you.

322
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Who are you talking to?

323
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
- Pam.
- She's not here,Jim!

324
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,000
No, she's not.

325
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,700
Yes!

326
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,100
I found it.
I found the perfect place.

327
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,800
A local bed and breakfast
on a 60-Acre beet farm.

328
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,100
And even better,
i have an in with the owner.

329
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, yeah,
we work together.

330
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,800
It's Dwight Schrute.

331
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,400
As in schrute farms.

332
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,400
<i>So i'd like to re-Double
my order.</i>

333
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,100
<i>If you could put me down
for, um--</i>

334
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Wait. Shut up.

335
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>- I'm sorry?
- Shh!</i>

336
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,900
Do you hear that?

337
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
<i>- Hear what?
- Breathing.</i>

338
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,500
<i>Is that you?
Well, i am breathing, yes.</i>

339
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Well, stop.
Hold your breath.

340
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,300
I still hear it.

341
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Who's there?

342
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,400
Kelly, is that you?

343
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,100
Hold on.

344
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,300
<i>I need paper.</i>

345
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,500
- Hyah!
- Aah!

346
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,500
Oh, my god,
you scared me!

347
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,700
Hear anything interesting?

348
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,500
What are you talking about?

349
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,200
I think you know.

350
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,700
You always say that,
and I almost never know.

351
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
What are you up to, girl?
Huh?

352
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,600
Phyllis put you up to this?

353
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,800
Stanley?
Are they paying you?

354
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,500
Are you accusing me
of something?

355
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,900
Of course I am.
I know you're the mastermind.

356
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
But you're too stupid
to do it by yourself.

357
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,400
- Okay...
- oh!

358
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,000
- Easy.
- Okay.

359
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Let's head back
to the desk.

360
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,500
You just can't come into my nook
and call me stupid.

361
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,800
<i>And maybe it you were a little
bit more nice and polite,</i>

362
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Then people wouldn't give you
such bad customer reviews.

363
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,100
Okay, the reason that i got
bad customer reviews

364
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,600
<i>Is because i didn't!</i>

365
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
There is a massive conspiracy
going on here,

366
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300
And i know you're involved.

367
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,900
Dwight, get out
of my nook!

368
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,200
That's what she said!
That's what she said!

369
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
<i>That's what she said!</i>

370
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,200
Good one.

371
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,800
Hey

372
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,700
Sorry about dwight,
by the way.

373
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,100
Yeah, he's weird.

374
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,400
Well, we all handle it
differently.

375
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,400
I personally choose to handle it
like a normal person, but...

376
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Okay.

377
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
Hey, how are you
and Darryl?

378
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,100
Um, we're cool.
Bye.

379
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,300
Bye.

380
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
<i>That was weird.</i>

381
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,000
What was?

382
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,500
<i>Have you ever had
a conversation with kelly</i>

383
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,600
Where she didn't go on for 15 minutes
without taking a breath?

384
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
<i>No, actually.</i>

385
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,500
Did you do something to her?

386
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,600
I don't think so.

387
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,100
<i>Well, something's off.</i>

388
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,800
Hey, how's things?

389
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,900
- All right.
- Yeah?

390
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,000
Livin' in the moment.

391
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,600
Do you have any reason to believe
that kelly would be mad at me?

392
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,900
Oh,I don't play
the politics game anymore,Jim.

393
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
<i>Can i tell you something?</i>

394
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,200
- I played it full-On in new york.
- Mm-Hmm.

395
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,700
I played it high stakes.
For keeps.

396
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Made it to the top.

397
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,700
But look what it cost.

398
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Can i tell you
what else i learned?

399
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,100
Wait, that's pretty weird.

400
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,900
What?

401
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,900
Andy has a mug
just like that.

402
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,700
Oh, yeah, kelly gave them out
as party favors.

403
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,000
Remember?
You got one.

404
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,300
No.
What party?

405
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,800
Her America's Got Talent
finale party Over the summer.

406
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,300
<i>That's crazy.
It was packed.</i>

407
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,500
<i>I thought everyone
was there.</i>

408
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,000
You were there.
I remember you being there.

409
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
I wasn't,
but thank you.

410
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,000
Hey, do you know anything
about this party?

411
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Yes,I said you
definitely should go,

412
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,400
But you wanted
to visit me instead.

413
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,200
I can't be the only one
who didn't...

414
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,500
Dwight...

415
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,900
Let me see
your coffee cup.

416
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,700
No!

417
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,300
- Is that it?
- No. Why?

418
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:56,800
No.

419
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,300
Okay, i'm gonna assume
that was it.

420
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,400
Here's the thing.
I think you're right.

421
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,700
I think it was Kelly.

422
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
I think she's mad at us
for not coming to her party.

423
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,300
Oh, man,I knew it.

424
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,600
- Who are her co-Conspirators?
- Probably just kelly.

425
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,600
Obviously.
I knew it.

426
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
- That's what i'm saying.
- Yeah. What?

427
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,000
You were right.

428
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
I was--
I was right.

429
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,900
- You were right.
- I was right.

430
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,000
- You knew it.
- I knew it.

431
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,100
You knew it
the whole time, buddy.

432
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,500
I knew it
the whole time,Buddy!

433
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,000
Wow! 

434
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
<i>Yeah! Whoo-Hoo!</i>

435
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,700
Right,
dwight is loud.

436
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,100
<i>Yeah! I knew it!</i>

437
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Yeah! Ha ha!

438
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
Whoo! Boom!

439
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Kelly the whole time!

440
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,800
- Let's get her.
- No, no, no, no.

441
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,600
Dwight,Dwight,Dwight,
let's talk about this.

442
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,700
What's going on?

443
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Why don't you tell us.

444
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,700
Nothing's going on.

445
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,200
Let me paint you a picture.

446
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,600
A little girl
from southern india,

447
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,700
<i>Who, despite being welcomed
into this country,</i>

448
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,000
Will now spend the rest
of her life in prison

449
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,900
<i>For a crime she did commit.</i>

450
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,600
Dwight
I was informed by these gentlemen

451
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,500
That the reports that you filed
may not entirely be accurate.

452
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,300
What?
I--

453
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,100
I don't know
what you're talking about.

454
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,600
This is the first
that i'm hearing about this.

455
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,500
Oh, come on!

456
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,400
You juked the stats,
cupcake.

457
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,500
We called about
a dozen customers,

458
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
and they all said that 
they gave us great marks.

459
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,500
<i>What's going on?</i>

460
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,500
I love your tie,Michael.

461
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,400
Oh...

462
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,200
Kelly.

463
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,200
I was raped.

464
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,100
You cannot say
"I was raped"

465
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,100
And expect all your problems
to go away,Kelly.

466
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,200
<i>Not again.
Don't keep doing that.</i>

467
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,700
I'll give you one last chance
to come clean.

468
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Just tell me
what happened.

469
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,100
Okay, all right.

470
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,700
Okay,I did it,
all right?

471
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,300
I lied, whatever.
Just fire me.

472
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,000
But you know what?

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,800
<i>I did it because you guys
didn't come to my party,</i>

474
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,300
And you said you would try to,
and then you didn't even show up,

475
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,800
And so you're bad friends.

476
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,900
We have our confession.

477
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,100
- I'm calling security...
- don't, don't!

478
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,300
Get away from that,
dwight, please.

479
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,700
You know what, she's got
a point about you too.

480
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,500
You do have a problem
dealing with people.

481
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,600
- See? I wasn't lying.
- You were lying.

482
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,100
<i>- I was lying.
- Yes.</i>

483
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,900
Jim,Dwight,
please excuse us.

484
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,200
But I want to be here
when you fire her ass.

485
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,800
I will call you
when it is time.

486
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:11,900
I have an enormous amount
of trouble

487
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,400
Trying to get people
to come to my place.

488
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,500
And I hate it.

489
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,800
I can't tell you how much
leftover guacamole

490
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,000
I have ended up eating
over the years.

491
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,000
I don't even know why I make it
in such great quantities.

492
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,200
Here's what
we're gonna do.

493
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,900
We are going to sit here
for a while,

494
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,100
Make it look good.

495
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,000
And maybe you should cry.

496
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,600
Can you make yourself cry?

497
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,400
No problem.

498
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,100
I think you should do that.

499
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,500
Pam beesly?

500
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,500
Hey. What are you
doing here?

501
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,800
Who's that?
It's alex.

502
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,300
It's pam.

503
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,300
I came to kidnap you.

504
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,300
There's free wine and cheese
at the chuck close retrospective--

505
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:09,900
Let's go.

506
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh,that's gonna be great.

507
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Who's chuck close?

508
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Oh,I love chuck close and
his photo-Realist paintings.

509
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,100
But I have to work.

510
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
Uh, well, actually
there's something else

511
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
I'd love to talk
to you about.

512
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,200
Um, can we go somewhere else
to talk about it?

513
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,300
Okay.

514
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,800
That's it,I want to talk
to this guy.

515
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,000
Put me in his ear.

516
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,400
- Um...
- What's up?

517
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm gonna take
a big leap.

518
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,400
And I want to tell you that
I think that you should not

519
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,900
Move back to Scranton.

520
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,800
Wow.

521
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,500
I'm gonna make
a bigger leap here.

522
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,900
He is into you.

523
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Why did you come to New York
in the first place?

524
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,400
Because they have
a great design program,

525
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,300
And I wanted to see
if i was any good at it.

526
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I wanted to work
on my art too.

527
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
Right.

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,800
And that's why i think
you should stay here.

529
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,800
'Cause,I mean, you--Really,
you just got here, you know?

530
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,100
And you can't do new york
in three months.

531
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,400
You know,
it has everything.It has...

532
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,300
All the opportunity
is here.

533
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,000
All the--The whole art scene
is in new york.

534
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,500
<i>You know, it would be nuts
to go back to scranton</i>

535
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,000
<i>Without getting
to fully experience it.</i>

536
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,100
Jim's in scranton.

537
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,200
I know,
but all I'm saying is,

538
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,500
If there's even
a teeny tiny part of you

539
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,700
That really wants to be
an artist,

540
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,200
Then I think
you should stay here.

541
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Because you don't want
to wake up in 50 years

542
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,300
<i>And look back and wonder
what could have been.</i>

543
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
<i>And that is the end
of my speech.</i>

544
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:36,400
<i>I planned it all.
Anyway...</i>

545
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,200
I will see you tomorrow.

546
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,900
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

547
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,700
Is that the matsuhashi b400?

548
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,800
The world's tiniest
bluetooth.

549
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,200
- May I?
- Don't.

550
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,900
Congratulations on choosing
Schrute Farms for your wedding.

551
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,500
No, we haven't decided
on anything yet.

552
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,500
We're still reviewing
some options,

553
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,900
And it's gonna come down
to the numbers.

554
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,700
Well, then, why don't you
look over some of our materials?

555
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,300
<i>Oh...hmm...</i>

556
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,400
<i>While i describe to you
the excalibur package.</i>

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,500
<i>In addition to the breathtaking
natural beauty</i>

558
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,500
<i>And smell of schrute farms,</i>

559
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,000
I can promise you
that our grounds can be catered

560
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,500
To fit your exact
specifications.

561
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I will work tirelessly for you
over the coming months,

562
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,300
<i>And be
at your constant disposal.</i>

563
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,900
<i>Please feel free</i>

564
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:41,200
To call or stop by any time
of the day or night.

565
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,900
That's very generous.

566
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,400
Well, you,
my good friend.

567
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,600
Have nothing more
to worry about.

568
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,200
This wedding is officially
out of your hands.

569
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,400
Oh, thank the good lord.
Deal!

570
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,400
Okay.

571
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,700
Um, what are we talking,
price wise?

572
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,000
- You already said deal.
- Yeah

573
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,400
Pay him whatever he wants.

574
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
Can't argue with that.

575
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Dwight...

576
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,300
You are gonna make us
so happy.
