1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,500
It's 4:30 in the morning.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,300
Do you know where your kids are?
???

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
If you are ryan's parents
or pam's parents Or my parents,

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
you do.

5
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,200
They're gonna be in this van.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,800
With me. Who am I?

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,900
Nothing to fear.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,900
I am just a 44-Year-Old guy
with a paper route.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,000
Time to make the donuts!

10
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,200
Come on.

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,200
Whoa!

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,100
No, I promise I won't do it again.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,600
Come on.

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,300
De-Nied!

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
We've been making 5:00 a.M.
Deliveries For a couple weeks now.

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
Ever since I've gotten clean,

17
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,400
There's something
about fresh morning air that...

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,300
just really makes me sick.

19
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,500
Hello! Time to ma the donuts!

20
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,900
Oh, halpert! Whoa!

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,500
Boner patrol, arrest that man!

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,900
Your donuts make me go nuts!

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,500
Hey, pam.

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,800
We got the van at a used car lot.

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
We t "alleluia church
of scranton" in korean.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,800
It was either this or an old school bus
With an owl living in it.

27
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,800
You didn't happen to bring
any coffee, did you, michael?

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Milk and sugar.

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,600
Oh, awesome. You're a life saver.

30
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,200
Wait, is this just milk and sugar?

31
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,400
That's what I said.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you drink this every day?

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,100
Every morning.

34
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,900
We're, uh, we're doing okay.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,900
A couple weeks in
and,m, we're having fun.

36
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,600
Uh, yep. We have 20--

37
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,800
- Oh, oh, excuse me.
- ???

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,300
Sorry. Sorry, no. It's, uh,

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,300
it's a paper company now.

40
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,500
It's not for the church.

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,700
http://notabenoid.com/book/2408/8079/

42
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,500
...

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
The Office S05E23

44
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Okay, who covers bans pet grooming?

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,500
Oh, they're my client.

46
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,400
NO. they were your client.

47
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,100
They just called and said

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
they're switching over
To michael scott paper company.

49
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,300
Shame, jim. I expected more.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
In the last month,

51
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,300
We have lost ten major
clients to michael scott.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
What are we supposed to do?

53
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,900
- They keep undercutting us on price.
- I don't want to hear excuses.

54
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,700
I want to see improvements.
This is unacceptable.

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,800
Hey, boss.

56
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,100
I'd just like to point out
That I have be here

57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,000
less time than these guys.

58
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Why are you telling me this?

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,100
I just think the bar
should be lower for a newbie.

60
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,100
Is this something
you really want to have said?

61
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't want to have said that.

62
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
But I think it's important
that you know it.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't know what to do
to inspire these people.

64
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,600
Okay, maybe it's my fault--

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
It's not your fault.

66
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,600
Some people just don't
want to be inspired.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
I wrote a memo to all departments

68
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Asng them to find ways to save money.

69
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,500
But, uh--

70
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,600
Charles, I got your memo. Thank you.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,500
I want you to know
I'm putting my foot down

72
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,900
When it comes to expense reports.

73
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,200
Waste not, want not.

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Uh, well said, an

75
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Been there, done that.

76
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,800
You know what we need?
We need some couches in here.

77
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Michael, we should really consider
Getting a delivery guy.

78
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,700
Oh, you know what you would love?

79
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,400
Isf we built a loft.

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
Why would I love that?

81
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,000
Can we afford a delivery guy?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,200
Like in a dorm room.

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,700
You put your desk underneath,
You have your loft up top.

84
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,000
You can sleep up top.

85
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,700
Yeah, I know what a loft is.

86
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,300
Most dorm rooms don't even have that.

87
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,700
Most do in the magazines.

88
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,600
Let's see what a delivery guy costs.

89
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,700
We should look into that.

90
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,100
Or we just go for the loft.

91
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,100
Hi. Hi.

92
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,400
Would you let charles know
that david is here,

93
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,600
- Sure.
- please?

94
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,100
Jim, hey.

95
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
- Hey, david.
- David wallace!

96
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,900
Hello, we've been expecting you,
david wallace.

97
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,300
Charles and I were waiting for you.

98
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,400
There he is.

99
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,600
There he is. How was the trip up?

100
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,900
Uh, a lot better than a month
At the scranton radisson, I'm sure.

101
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Oh, you know,
it hasn't been that bad.

102
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,700
Hasn't been that bad.

103
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
These people are the salt
of the earth down here.

104
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,400
You couldn't ask for
a better way to learn a company.

105
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,400
I feel like I should be thanking you.

106
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,300
The conference room is ready
If we want to get started.

107
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,300
You know, I just want
to address everyone first.

108
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Oh, yeah. Take your time.

109
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Stanley, pay attention.

110
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,800
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

111
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,300
Hi.

112
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,500
- Look. It's no secret--
- Hi.

113
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,300
Hello. Uh, it is no secret

114
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,900
That michael scott paper has siphoned
off A largchunk of our core business.

115
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,800
And I'm here-- I just
want to reassure everyone

116
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,700
That we think this is
just a temporary setback.

117
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,500
- Right.
- Okay?

118
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,700
Maybe, and I don't know,

119
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,600
If you had just returned michael's call,
None of us would've lost clients.

120
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
I've been wondering
that myself lately.

121
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Wee just gonna get started.
We're gonna figure this out.

122
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Rest assured. Jim,
can you come in with us please?

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,300
Uh, jim. Hold on.

124
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,800
You know, david,
Uh, dwight's been my guy.

125
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,000
- Okay? Yeah, jim, uh...
- Hmm.

126
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
Really? I find that
extraordinarily surprising.

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
He shows promise.

128
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,800
And jim, I don't-- I--
He's been disappointment.

129
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,500
We'll bring 'em both in.

130
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,700
Okay, great.
Uh, dwight, come on in.

131
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,400
Also jim.

132
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,400
Come along, after thought.

133
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,300
How much can we afford
to pay a delivery guy?

134
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,100
Well, if these numbers
you gave me are correct--

135
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,600
They are correct, sir.

136
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Then u can't afford
to pay him anything.

137
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay.

138
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,700
A empt ahumor.
Swing and a miss.

139
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
Your prices are too low.

140
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,000
Lowest in town.

141
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
Why do you think
staples and dunder mifflin

142
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,700
Can't match your prices?

143
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Corporate greed?

144
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,700
Look, our pricing model is fine.

145
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,100
I reviewed the numbers myself.

146
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Over time with enough volume,
weece profitable.

147
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Yeah, with a fixed cost
pricing model that's correct.

148
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Yeah.

149
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,200
But you need to use a
variable cost pricing model.

150
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,600
Okay, sure.

151
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Right. So...

152
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,200
Why don't you explain
what that is to--

153
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
So they can under--

154
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
- ???
- Just explain what that is.

155
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Explain what you think that is.

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,300
- Okay.
- Just explain that.

157
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,500
As you sell more paper
And your company grows,

158
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,700
So will your costs.

159
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,700
For example, delivery man,

160
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,500
Health care.

161
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, we don't--
Business expansion.

162
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,300
Whatever, yeah. So--

163
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
At these prices,
the more paper you sell

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
The less money you'll make.

165
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,300
Our prices are the only thing
Keeping us in business.

166
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,300
They're actually
putting you out of business.

167
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
Okay, okay.

168
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,600
Hold on, hold on.

169
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,300
Ty, I would like you to
crunch those numbers again.

170
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,400
It's a program.
There's no such thing--

171
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,500
Just crunch 'em.
Just crunch 'em please.

172
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Crunch.

173
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
Did it help?

174
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
Hi, jerry. Michael scott.

175
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,300
Well, this is slightly embarrassing.

176
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,000
Um, I'm going to have to...

177
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,200
Ask you to pay me
a little bit more money

178
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,300
For that delivery
we dropped off yesterday.

179
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,500
Yeah. We did.
We got the check.

180
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
But we're just going to need
A much, much bigger check.

181
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,100
When a child gets
behind the wheel of a car

182
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,400
And runs into a tree,

183
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,400
You don't blame the child.

184
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,000
He didn't know any better.

185
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,700
You blame the 30-Year-Old woman

186
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,900
Who got in the passenger seat

187
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,200
And said, "drive, kid. I trust you."

188
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,100
Now would corporate approve
a temporary price reduction

189
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,100
For returning customers?

190
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,300
- God, no.
- Stupid.

191
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
Yeah, makes us look weak.

192
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,900
I agree. It just--

193
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,300
I say we fill
michael's office with bees.

194
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,100
My apiarist owes me a favor.

195
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,400
Really? Does hdo good work or--

196
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,900
No, jim. I use a bad apiarist.

197
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,300
Fellas, why don't
we take a five-Minute break?

198
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,800
And then we will come back, start fresh,

199
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,200
Sort this out.

200
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,500
Five mites exactly.

201
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,500
Okay.

202
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,200
Hey, dwight. Can I talk to you?

203
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,500
- Sure thing.
- Yeah.

204
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,900
Hey.

205
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,100
I saw you called.

206
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,300
You're just out of business?

207
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,800
We have maybe a month.

208
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,400
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

209
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, yeah, well, don't worry about it.

210
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,200
We'll figure it out. We'll be okay.

211
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,600
That's what michael said.

212
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,100
Oh, yeah, only this
time wewillbe okay.

213
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,000
Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
- Oh, that's my new "dwight" ring.

214
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,400
- I like it.
- Good, right?

215
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,500
Hello.

216
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,900
Idiot, we're starting back up.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
This is dwight, by the way.

218
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
Oh, okay.

219
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
Don't worry about it.

220
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Did I ever tell you about the day
That steve martin died?

221
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,100
- Steve martin's not dead, michael.
- I know.

222
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,600
But I always thought

223
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,700
That the day that he died
Would be the worst day of my life.

224
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,300
And I was wrong. It's this.

225
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
You want to hear something sad?

226
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
I would love that.

227
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,600
So jim and I are getting married

228
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
And the wedding's really expensive,

229
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,700
So I tried to get a job on the weekends
To earn extra money.

230
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I applied to old navy,
target, and wal-Mart.

231
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,300
None of 'em called me back.

232
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,000
Not even for an interview.

233
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
I never went to thailand.

234
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,300
Really?

235
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,000
I went to fort lauderdale.

236
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,700
Was it nice?

237
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,500
Yeah, it was amazing.

238
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,800
There was a great
pad thai place, though.

239
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,000
I love pad thai.

240
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,200
You never had pad thai.

241
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
No.

242
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,900
There's a lot I haven't done.

243
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Now, this is the projection

244
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,200
- of over three months.
- ???

245
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,600
We still have the inventory sitting--

246
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,800
- ???
- ??

247
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,900
Let me float
something out there, okay?

248
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,400
Can I just say--

249
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
- Can I say something?
- ???
- Yeah, yeah.

250
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,700
There is a hive of bees

251
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,300
outside the front door.

252
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,100
We kidnap the queen,

253
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,200
Extract her alarm pheromones,

254
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,000
Place them on a flushable wipe.

255
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,700
Put that in his bathroom.

256
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,900
I can't believe
I'm about to say this, but..

257
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,300
the cheapest option...

258
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,900
Is to make michael an offer.

259
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes.

260
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,900
Yes, I was gonna say the same thing.
We should buy him out.

261
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,900
- Oh, but you didn't.
- ??

262
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, man!

263
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,300
If only michael had children.

264
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,400
That's how you really
apply the pressure.

265
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,400
What is wrong with you?

266
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Jim, you're-- You're
pretty close with him.

267
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,500
You think they'd be up
for hearing an offer?

268
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
Oh, I don't know.

269
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,700
You know, they've taken
a good deal of clients, so.

270
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
I mean, I guess-- I guess
I could go down there

271
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,800
And try to nudgehe in
the right direction.

272
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,700
- You know what?
- ???

273
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Why don't I do it, okay?

274
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,800
Michael adores me.
I'm the man for this job.

275
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Charles, you got my back on this?

276
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,300
No, jim, I think you should go.

277
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,200
Okay, so I'll be back in, um...

278
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,500
Back in a bit.

279
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,200
Hey, can I talk to
you guys for a second?

280
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
We're not hiring, jim.

281
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,400
Actually here for something else.

282
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,100
Listen, I can't
make you laugh right now.

283
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,300
You know I love a good guessing game,

284
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
But why don't I just
tell you what I'm here for?

285
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,300
Turns out you guys have
made a pretty big dent

286
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
In the dunder mifflin sales.

287
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,900
Oh, that's nice.

288
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
David wallace has
asked me to come down here

289
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,000
And see if you would be interested
In dundemifflin buying you out.

290
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Seriously?

291
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,500
Are you being serious?

292
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,300
He's bluffing, pam.

293
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,700
Jim, what you donundetand
Is that this company's worthl--

294
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,100
- Oh!
- No--

295
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
- We don't have--
- Oh!

296
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,600
See, I'm here to learn as
little information as possible.

297
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
All I really need to hear

298
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,900
Is if your incredibly successful company

299
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Would be receptive to a buyout.

300
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,200
Yes.

301
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,200
- Yes.
- Maybe.

302
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,900
Three yes.

303
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,900
I will see you titans of industry

304
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,900
Upstairs.

305
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Yes, well, we're
not only tight-Ends,

306
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,500
We are also quarterbacks.

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,500
Missed the last part.

308
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,000
- That's a pun.
- Got it.

309
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Yep!

310
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,400
Oh. Wow.

311
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
Okay, so you're not
going to reveal in any way

312
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,600
That we're broke.

313
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,400
Of course not.

314
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
That we're having
any problems at all.

315
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,700
- Nope, ne,ope.
- Right.

316
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,100
Just to reiterate, none of us
Is going to say anything

317
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,700
That might indicate we are going broke.

318
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,600
Right. Right.

319
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,700
There is no way in hell

320
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,500
That I am going to say that we're broke.

321
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,700
Oh, I'm really worried I'm gonna say it.

322
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,600
No, michael.

323
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,300
- ??
- A no, man.

324
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,600
You're-- You're fine.

325
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,400
We have to come from

326
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,700
- a position of strength.
- I'm good, I'm good.

327
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,800
Just put it out of your mind.

328
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,700
It is. I'm good.

329
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,500
- Hello.
- Hi.

330
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,500
Michael scott paper company
To see mr. David wallace.

331
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,900
I believe we're expected.

332
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
Well, well, well.

333
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,100
How the turntables...

334
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Michael, in order to
expedite these negotiations,

335
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
We are prepared to make you
a very generous offer.

336
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,400
And we are prepared
to reject that offer.

337
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,000
Michael, you haven't even heard--

338
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,300
Never accept their first offer.

339
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,800
What is your second offer?

340
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,800
$12,000.

341
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,200
Are you kidding me?
That is insultingly low.

342
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,900
I don't even want to hear
what your first offer was.

343
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,700
What do you hear?

344
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,400
Here's the situation.

345
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,200
Your company is four weeks old.

346
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,500
I know this business.
I know what suppliers are charging.

347
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I know you can't be
making very mucmoney.

348
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
I don't know how your prices are so low

349
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,200
But I know it can't keep up that way.

350
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,800
I'm sure you're scared.

351
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,000
Probably in debt.

352
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,800
This is the best offer you're gonna get.

353
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll see your situation
and I'll raise you a situation.

354
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Your company is losing
clients left a right.

355
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
You have a stockholder meeting coming up

356
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
And you're going to
have to explain to them

357
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Why your most profitable branch

358
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,700
is bleeding.

359
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
So they may be looking for
a little change in the cfo.

360
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,100
So I don't think I need
to wait out dunder mifflin.

361
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,900
I thk I just have to wait out you.

362
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,600
Okay, now, I don't know
that I can get this.

363
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,700
I do have to go to
the board for approval.

364
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,300
How's about $60,000?

365
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,700
60 thou.

366
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,800
Michael.

367
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,700
- What?
- We'll have to talk-- 

368
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,800
We're gonna have to talk about this.

369
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,800
Just amongst ourselves.

370
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,600
Okay, yes. Please take the room.

371
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,800
Be right outside.

372
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,500
Take your time.

373
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,400
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

374
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:52,400
- $60,000. Are you kidding me?
- We are so rich.

375
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,700
Well, jerry, the one who got away.

376
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,700
May I ask why you're leaving
The michael scott paper company?

377
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,100
Really?

378
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,400
Please hold.

379
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,700
- Charles.
- Dwight.

380
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
May I have your attention?

381
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
The michael scott
paper company is broke.

382
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,600
What? How'd you hear that?

383
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,900
They've been calling
all of their clients

384
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,700
And begging them to pay more money.

385
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,400
That can only mean one thing.
They're desperate.

386
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,900
Which can only mean one thing.

387
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,900
They're total failures.

388
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,400
- Great work, dwight.
- Quiet, you.

389
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,500
No, I mean, great detective work.

390
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,800
'Cause this must be the first case
You've ever cracked, right?

391
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,400
You don't crack a case.

392
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,200
At has a pejorative connotation.
That's like calling a policeman a cop.

393
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,800
You solve a case, and yes,
I've solved plenty.

394
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
So how long can they stay viable?

395
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
What are your top five cases?

396
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm gonna answer charles first.

397
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,100
Because you've solved zero cases.

398
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,100
Okay, one. Case of the beet bandit.

399
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,400
Missing beets from all over the farm.
No footpris. Inside job.

400
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,500
Mose in socks. Boom, case closed.

401
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay, do not go anywhere
near the conference room.

402
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Done.

403
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,500
Because you have embarrassed me
For the last time today.

404
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Got it?

405
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm not-- I'm
not following you.

406
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
You two are morons.

407
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,000
Got it.

408
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,200
- Wh--
- Get out.

409
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,100
So you've thought it over, yes,
And you accept our offer.

410
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
We can finally put
this whole thing behind us?

411
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,600
No.

412
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Can you give us
another minute please?

413
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,000
Yeah.

414
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,300
Oh, okay.

415
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,300
- Michael.
- How could you do this to me, michael?

416
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,200
You just cost me $60,000.

417
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Why are you assuming
you'd get the whole thing?

418
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
It's a lot of money, okay.

419
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,100
But we need money coming in every week.

420
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,500
We need jobs.

421
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
Wouldn't you rather
have a fishing pole than a fish?

422
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,500
I would rather have 60,000, honestly.

423
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,300
No, michael's right.

424
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,700
Jobs are safer.

425
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,300
Agreed?

426
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,200
Agreed.
- Yeah.

427
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,700
But that's all, okay.

428
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,700
Yeah, discuss these things--

429
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,600
Shut up, shut up.

430
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:14,900
Hello?

431
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
I nt my old job back.

432
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,500
I want my old parking space back.

433
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,900
I want a sebring.

434
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,100
They don't make them anymore.

435
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
And I want charles gone.

436
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,500
I am not firing charles.
He's very valuable.

437
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,800
That's very kind of you
to say, david.

438
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,900
I need him gone.

439
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,800
No.

440
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,800
Okay, then I want pam back.

441
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,800
Uh, you already have
a new receptionist--

442
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,700
Sales.

443
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,600
Thank you.

444
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,900
Pam's not a salesperson.

445
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,100
Yes, she is.

446
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,300
At the michael scott
paper company in its heyday.

447
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,100
That's right.

448
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:43,900
Okay.

449
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,900
Please continue.

450
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,000
And ryan.

451
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,100
Ryan cost dunder mifflin

452
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,900
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars, michael.

453
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,000
- Ryan is--
- You know, david,

454
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,800
I don't care if ryan
murdered his entire family.

455
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
He is like a son to me.

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,900
Do you realize what
you're asking for here?

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,800
You're talking about
salary plus health benefits.

458
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,300
And dental this time.

459
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,000
Insurance, taxes,
social security for three people.

460
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,600
This is a heck of
a lot more than 60 grand.

461
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,400
You're talking about
a multi-Million dollar buyout.

462
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,700
These are our demands.

463
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,200
Your company cannot
be worth that much.

464
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
Our company is worth nothing.

465
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
That's the difference between you and I.

466
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
Business isn't about money to me, david.

467
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,700
If tomrow my company goes under,

468
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
I will just start another paper company.

469
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,500
And then another
and another and another.

470
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,300
I have no shortage of company names.

471
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,800
- Michael.
- That's one of 'em!

472
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,100
Yes.

473
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,800
These are our demands.

474
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,300
This is what we want.

475
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,300
Our balls are in your court.

476
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,600
Okay. Deal.

477
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,100
Okay?

478
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,700
Can whave the room please?

479
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,500
Yeah.

480
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,200
Yes! Can you believe it?

481
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,600
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Great job!

482
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,100
Right here!
That's what I'm talking about!

483
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,200
There are certain defining moments
in a person's life.

484
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
The day he is born.

485
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,100
The day he grows hair.

486
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,800
The day he starts a business.

487
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,900
And the day he sells that business
back to dunder mifflin.

488
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,900
What have I learned from all of this?

489
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,700
It is far too early to tell.

490
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,900
I just know that I am flying high

491
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,900
And I don't even want to think about it.

492
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,300
I just want to enjoy it.

493
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,700
- Hey, guys--
- No, no. You're done.

494
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:59,700
HWHWHhwhwhWHHWhwhhwhWHHWH!!!
