1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:02,890
well, I should go.

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,240
All right.I'll tell everybody
here that you say hi.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,280
No,don'T.I'm mad at them.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:08,410
Why?What happened?

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,300
Not one of them called to
congratulate me on our engagement.

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:16,800
That they might be off the hook
for,because i didn't tell them.

7
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,720
What?Why not?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,070
I just didn't,you know,want to deal-

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,890
- come on,it won't be that bad.
- Okay,you know what?

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,990
Here we go.

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,730
Uh,everybody,just wanted
to make an announcement.

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,040
- Pam and I are engaged.
- Hi,everyone.

13
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,100
I thought you were already engaged.

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,550
- Nope.
- That was roy.

15
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:40,230
She was engaged to roy.

16
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,290
Thank you,angela.

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,500
I got a gift for pam and roy.

18
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,980
- Do I have to get another one?
- Yes.

19
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,050
A little close what'soing on?

20
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,580

Nothing,michael.Just saying hi.

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,720
The tall guy got engaged.

25
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:02,480
- To be married?
- Yep.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,600

Just kidding.Take your time.

32
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:34,520
today is ethics day.

33
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,630
After they finish the quiz,I'm
gonna run my first meeting here.

34
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,330
It's gonna be in-sane!

35
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,880
No,it's not.I have to
read from the binder.

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,510
I got it.I got it.

37
00:01:49,690 --> 00:01:52,840
I took you to an intimate restaurant

38
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,750
then to a suggestive movie

39
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,960
there's nothing left to talk about

40
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,810
unless it's horizontally

41
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,460
let's get ethical,ethical

42
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,720
I wanna get ethical
let's get into ethics,

43
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,140
yeah let me hear dunder mifflin talk

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,990
your body talk let
me hear your body talk

45
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,340
All right!

46
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,860
Why are you helping
her?You're not even dating.

47
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,770
She's my friend,and
ultimately my strategy

48
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:31,640
is to sort of merge
this into a relationship

49
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,640
without her even knowing.

50
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,830
Okay,let's give it up
for miss holly flax!

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,150
thanks,michael.

52
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,060
Today we're gonna have a business
ethics seminar,because recently,

53
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,700
without mentioning any names,there
has been some misconduct at corporate.

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,300
And we have a very strict ethics
policy,and that employee has been fired.

55
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,210
Oh,come on.He's right there.

56
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,850
He was hired.

57
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,430
- Ooh,check it out,hired guy.
- Nice.

58
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,510
Okay,elephant in the room.

59
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,200
Let's talk about it.

60
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,720
Do I regret what I did?

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,900
Of course I do,even though it was an
amazing ride,and I'll give you an example.

62
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,250
Anyone see survivor,season six?

63
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,120
Anyone know joanna on that show?

64
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,350
In new york city,I hooked up with a
girl who looked exactly like that--

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,270
- indistinguishable,so...
- okay.

66
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,050
Well done.Good
speech,ryan.You're a good guy.

67
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,960
let's start discussing those questionnaires
that you filled in this morning.

68
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,890
"It is wrong to make personal
calls during work hours?

69
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,830
"Now,some of you marked
that you very strongly agree.

70
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,390
But ideally you would've
selected totally agree."

71
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,170
I thought very strongly agree"
sounded stronger than "totally agree.

72
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,090
"Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally
you would all totally agree with that statement.

73
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:54,320
Well,I think we can all totally
agree that holly is totally fantastic.

74
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,340
Thank you.

75
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:02,290
Okay,in fact,""spending a half hour at the
watercooler during work hours is a form of stealing."

76
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,620
- What?
- Yes,it's called time theft,

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,270
and it's the same as taking
money from the company.

78
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,220
Can anyonehink of examples of things
that are over-the-line time-wasters?

79
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,290
This meeting.

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,870
Can't set them up like that.

81
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,560
why is it okay for smokers
to take breaks all the time?

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,440
If I want to go outside and hang out once
an hour,then I'll just take up smoking.

83
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,380
I'll do it.I don't care.

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,690
I'll smoke with you.I got
a bag of cigars in my purse.

85
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,690
Stealing office supplies is another big ethical
area that there seems to be some confusion about.

86
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,410
Okay.Can we have a moment?

87
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,480
Can I talk to you for a second?

88
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,000
A lot of good stuff,and you look-

89
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,790
- you look fantastic.
- michael.

90
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,730
- Yeah?
- What should we be working on while you guys are talking?

91
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,870
Do some--do
some work.

92
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,220
People expect a lot
from these meetings--

93
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,170
laughter,sudden twists,surprise endings.

94
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,240
You need to be robin williams
and M.Night shyamalan.

95
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,160
You need to be robin shyamalan.

96
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,430
- Well,I just have to get through the binder.
- Well,it's...just.... you're kind of losing them.

97
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:03,410
- I am?
- Yeah,don't think about the stakes.

98
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,810
- It'll freak you out.
- Okay.

99
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,360
Well,Michael makes a really good point.

100
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,950
So,uh,let's just open
this up a little bit.

101
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,930
Say my name is lauren,and here
I am shopping in a supermarket,

102
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:19,220
and I steal a pencil.That's not right.

103
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,170
Lauren,enough with the pencils.

104
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,390
No,I have to go over
pencils and office supplies.

105
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,960
It's part of the ethics thing.

106
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,710
That isn't ethics.

107
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,380
Ethics is a real discussion of
competing conceptions of the good.

108
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,340
This is just the corporate
anti-shoplifting rules.

109
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,130
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.

110
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,490
Would you steal bread
to feed your family?

111
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,880
- Boom!
- Exactly,andy.

112
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,440
Yeah,I took intro to
philosophy twice-- no big deal.

113
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,980
It's a trick question.The
bread is poisoned.

114
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,840
Also,it's not your real family.

115
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,690
You've been cuckolded by
a stronger,smarter male.

116
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,570
No,that's not how it works.

117
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,560
I would not steal the bread.

118
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:03,060
And I would not let my family go hungry.

119
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,570
okay,but we should get back to business.

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:10,400
Have any of you ever faced any
ethical dilemmas in the workplace?

121
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,550
anybody?

122
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,890
This is a chance for you to say
something without any repercussions.

123
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:18,430
Stanley?Oscar,come on.

124
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,650
Pass.

125
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,310
I will go first.

126
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,830
When I discovered youtube,I
didn't work for five days.

127
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,120
I did nothing.

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,590
I viewed cookie monster sings
chocolate rain about 1,000 times.

129
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,490
What was the dilemma?

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,310
To tell you or not,and I'm glad I did.

131
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,770
I feel very,very good and catharctic."

132
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,420
"I promise you that you are
not going to get into trouble.

133
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,070
You can say anything you want
with total and complete immunity.

134
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,290
- Oh,no,no.
- Yeah.Come on.Anybody?

135
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,830
- Let it fly.-
Okay,once--

136
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:53,140
once in a while,I--
I'll take a long lunch.

137
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,350
- A siesta.
- time thief.Time thief...fire him.

138
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,190
dwight,you've really never
stolen any company time?

139
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,160
Never.

140
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:03,680
You are a thief of joy.

141
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,990
- Anybody else?
- Yeah.

142
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,200
Sometimes I download pirated
music onto my work computer.

143
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,850
Who hasn't?Good.Good!What else?

144
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,550
No,no,I'd like to hear more about that.

145
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,840
I once reported oscar to the I.N.S.

146
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,930
Turns out he's clean,but
I'm glad I did it.

147
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,980
- Well,let's keep this party moving on.
- I'll go.

148
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,510
Have you guys ever met bruce
myers,the scranton rep for hammermill?

149
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,230

Bru-u-ce!

150
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,360
Well,for the past six years,I've been
sleeping with him in exchange for discounts

151
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,910
on our supplies and
outback steakhousegift ccat.

152
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,980
Jackpot.

153
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:42,520
Meredith,that is serious.

154
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,570
I-I mean,not onlythat f interest,But
there's also an exchangof goods.

155
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,580
Exchange of steak.

156
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,620
Have you ever had sirloin steak,honey?

157
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,440
that's crazy.That's crazy talk.

158
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,110
Meredith.

159
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,810
The merenator,""
sleeping with suppliers."

160
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,170
What time do we got?

161
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,090
You know what?That's a good
place to end it,right there.

162
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,150
This,I think,was a great ethics seminar.

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,550
She has given us a lot of
wonderful things to think about.

164
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:19,110
Right,what is wrong-- who's
to say,really,in the end?

165
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,290
I mean,because it is unknowable,but
let's give her a round of applause.

166
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,740
Holly,everybody.Holly.

167
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Get back to work.

168
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,860
great job.

169
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,630
I am truly impressed.

170
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,960
That,uh-- you really pulled that
one out.Classic,classic meeting.

171
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,310
- We should celebrate.
- Michael,

172
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,210
there are some serious
issues with meredith.

173
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:45,640
I mean,all of you have done things wouldn't have done
myself,but meredith's actions are realver the line.

174
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

175
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,040
What you gonna do?

176
00:08:54,210 --> 00:09:00,210
So,regarding the supplier,approximately
how many lhave th?

177
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,500
Liaisons?You mean mee i don't ow.

178
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,280
Once aonor six years,somethin,

179
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,690
ly it's not what she thinks,

180
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:16,950
nothing unethical happened and
that you just like to sleep around.

181
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,490
Am I in trouble here or something?

182
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,460
No,no.This is just a stupid formality.

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,020
No,it's not a formality.

184
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,790
Now,were ese,um,meet-ups just
personal,unreted to business?

185
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
No.I wouldn't havne it if it
wasn't for the discount paper.

186
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,780
There's not a lot
ofruruit in those looms.

187
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,420
For the love of god,wee
trying to help you,stupidag.

188
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:44,410
What ionon't understand
is-- why the steak coupons,

189
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,580
I mean,if you were already
getting the discounted paper?

190
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,210
Well,it's funny.

191
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,990
Maybe it's a girl
thing,but after we did it,

192
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,890
when he would give me those
coupons,I just felt good about myself.

193
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,830
Hey,what's going on here?

194
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,260
I thought I had immunity.

195
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:10,430
well,unfortunately,immunity or something being
off the record does not really exist workplace.

196
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,090
I mean,I've never heard of anyone whkept
their job after something like this.

197
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,270
Well,I'm not quitting.

198
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,510
Yawn-- four
seconds.

199
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,080
What are you doing?

200
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:38,310
Oh,you had said that you don't do anything
personal during work time,so I'm just making sure.

201
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,590
Oh,wait a minute.So you're
gonna time me every time I yawn?

202
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,190
That absurd.

203
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:44,530
Really?

204
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,870
Oh,hey,look,monkey knows how
to use a stopwatch,everybody.

205
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,630
He's
ti--

206
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,490
Personal conversation--
17 seconds.

207
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,750
There is no
wa that was--

208
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,080
One second.

209
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,350
Well,well,holly-lujah.

210
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,710
It's a miracle.You're at your desk.

211
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,030
It's mike-raculous.

212
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,170
Ooh,ooh,reaching.

213
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,770
You'll get there.Anyway,

214
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:24,500
I was giving it some thought,and there's no
reason that two attractive,good-looking...

215
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:30,570
intelligent,funny,attractive
people can't,you know,

216
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:33,140
just sit down and work this
whole meredith thing out.

217
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,740
Sounds g good.

218
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,660
Would you care to
bang it out over lunch?

219
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,570
Oh,I already bought this.

220
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,550
Oh,no.No,no.

221
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:46,760
Your food is no good here,my lady.

222
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,930
Oh,sorry.

223
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:53,210
You know what?Let's go
out,dunder mifflin's treat.

224
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,870
actually,you're not a
client,so we'll just split it?

225
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,270
Ethical.

226
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,860
So I've gone over corporate policy.

227
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,550
What do you think?

228
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,080
What do you think of this place?

229
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,570
- oh,it's very nice.
- isn't it?

230
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:15,940
Yeah,it's kind of business/romantic.

231
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,810
So you're from des moines?

232
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,660
Wow,that sounds so warm.

233
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,610
In summer.

234
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,210
Here too.

235
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,030
You know what my favorite season is?

236
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,750
Maybe we should talk
about meredith first.

237
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,020
Yes.Yeah.Get the boring
stuff out of the way.

238
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,520
Autumn was what I was gonna say.

239
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,110
When the leave change,it's just-- I-I think
it's the most contemplative of seasons.

240
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:42,120
Okay,so I've gone over
this,and I've thought about it,

241
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:47,960
and I just don't think there's any way I can write
a report that doesn't end with her being terminated.

242
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,700
Terminator.

243
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,470
Terminator.

244
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,430
I'm from the future.

245
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,130
Yeah.

246
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,210
Hey,andy.

247
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,280
Yo.

248
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,960
By any chance,did you see
battlestar galactica last night?

249
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,670
No,I did not.Is that any good?

250
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,750
Actually not.It is really so-so.

251
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,170
Okay.

252
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:11,610
I mean,I like all the crazy
monsters and stuff,you know,

253
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,750
like klingons and wookies
and all that,but...

254
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,500
sorry,was there something
you wanted to add,dwight?

255
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,640
Is that anything like the
original battlestar galactica?

256
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,090
You know,it's weird.

257
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,650
It's practically a
shot-for-shot remake.

258
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,390
Really?

259
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,390
Huh,that's cool.

260
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,710
Story's kind of bland.

261
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,560
- It's about this guy named dumbledore calrissian,
- okay.

262
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:41,390
Who needs to return
the ring back to mordor.

263
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,880
It's really...

264
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:45,300
that doesn't sound right.

265
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,760
I just don't want my employees thinking
that their jobs depend on performance.

266
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,800
I .

267
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:56,640
What sort of place is that to call home?

268
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:59,200
And meredith needs this job.

269
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,280
This is her main source of money.

270
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,130
Well,that's very sweet,but we have to
follow the protocol.Those are the rules.

271
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,320
Okay,new idea-- we don't report
her at all.We just punish her.

272
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,870
We punish her?

273
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,430
Tell her,can't have sex for six months.

274
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,510
I don't think we could enforce that.

275
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,190
I don't know.I saw this
thing-- like a belt with a key.

276
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,620
A chastity belt.

277
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,490
Yeah,it's more of A...

278
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,980
underwear garment that has
little spikes,like,made of--

279
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,730
I think sometimes they're made of
metal.You know what I'm talking about.

280
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:33,250
You unlock a little
door that-- down...

281
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,040
where you-- where you
put-- where you put the--

282
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,120
he has not stopped working for a second.

283
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:54,720
At 12:45,he sneezed while
keeping his eyes open,

284
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,500
which I always thought was impossible.

285
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,300
at 1:32,he peed,and I know that because he
did it in an open soda bottle under the desk

286
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,380
while filling out expense reports.

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,010
And on the flip side,I've been so busy
watching him that I haven't even started work.

288
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:13,060
It's exhausting being this vigilant.

289
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,270
I'll probably have to
go home early today.

290
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,940
I am just saying that I don't think
that you understand what I am saying.

291
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:25,660
No,you are saying that we
should sweep it under the carpet,

292
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,000
accept the discount on supplies,not fire meredith,and
pretend like the whole thing never happened.

293
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,610
Yes.

294
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,940
What am I saying?

295
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,780
Well...

296
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,830
blugh,busted.I
don't--

297
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm saying that her behavior
is unethical and a little icky,

298
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,790
and I don't think I want to work in an environment
where that sort of conduct is tolerated.

299
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,380
Well,you have to tolerate a lot
when you're part of a family.

300
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,710
It's not a family.It's a workplace.

301
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,460
I will be honest with you,that
car ride did not go well.

302
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,670
And that was not my fault.

303
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:17,790
The only reason I am standing out here right now is
because I don't want to take the elevator with her.

304
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,940
And I am holding on to her leftovers.

305
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,640
19 minutes and 48 seconds.

306
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,740
What were we doing for 19
minutes and 48 seconds,dwight?

307
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,800
None of your business.

308
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,030
So I guess I can assume that was..

309
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,060
personal.

310
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,800
Fine.

311
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,240
So maybe you're not
completely ethical after all.

312
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:04,890
Yes... maybe I'm not.

313
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,660
It's been a little tense.

314
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,620
People are suspicious of me,and my best
friend in the office won't even talk to me.

315
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,610
It turns out being the morality
police does not make you popular.

316
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,350
I should know,because in middle
school,I was the hall monitor,

317
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:42,420
and the kids used to stuff
egg salad in my locker.

318
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,660
Yeah,I was just hoping
middle school was over.

319
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,910
Kendall from corporate H.R.Is on line
one,and holly's on her way in,too.

320
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,490
What's the only thing
worse than one H.R.Rep?

321
00:17:57,570 --> 00:18:00,680
- Two H.R.Reps.
- You get me.

322
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,540
- Can I sit?
- I don't know.Can you?

323
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,360
Kendall,my main man.

324
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,630
listen,holly,michael,I just got the
report that your branch submitted,

325
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,380
and there's a lot of stuff about
a relationship meredith is having--

326
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,730
yes,that came out during
the ethics seminar.

327
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,380
And let the record show that it was
during the immunity part of the seminar.

328
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:24,360
Well,I'm not sure these
circumstances warrant any action.

329
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,630
Oh,I think it's pretty
clear it was unethical.

330
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,330
Oh,from what I can gather,it
seems like a gray area.

331
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,130
Look,to be honest,the company's getting a
discount at a tough time in our balance sheet,

332
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,260
and I don't know that the right thing to do
for the company is to turn our noses up at that.

333
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,660
Um,kendall,I understand that the
discount is good for the company,

334
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:44,530
but I'm just not happy about
the way we're getting it.

335
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,500
I thought it was clear with you,holly.

336
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:52,010
Your tk was to get signatures from the employees
showing that they completed the training.

337
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:55,330
- No,I understand.
- good,'cause every other branch has managed to get those to us.

338
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,320
So,if it's not something you can
handle,hat's a different discussion.

339
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,130
- No,I ca...cado
- good.

340
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,570
how do you tell somebody that you
care about deeply,"I told you so"?

341
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,320
Gently?With a rose?

342
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:22,480
In a funny way,like it's a hilarious jo

343
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,140
or do you just let it go

344
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:29,110
because saying it would
just make things worse?

345
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,320
Probably the funny way.

346
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,730
Can I have everyone's attention?

347
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,870
Excuse me!May I have
everyone's attention,please?

348
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,550
We need to finish the ethics seminar.

349
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,820
- No way,lady.
- it's a trap.

350
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,900
Everyone,please,I just need your signatures
to show corporate that I gave you the training.

351
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,260
- Don't sign anything.
- Okay,everybody listen up.

352
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,050
If you are not in that conference room
in two minutes,I am going to kill you.

353
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,060
It's a quarter to 5:00,and I
have started to gather my things.

354
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,650
Get in there right
now,or I'm gonna lose it!

355
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,020
Am I getting fired?

356
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,730
Now is really not the time,meredith.

357
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,760
In this next section,we examine the
difference between sick days and personal days.

358
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,630
Sick days are only to be used when an
illness precludes you from doing your job

359
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,200
or can spread to your coworkers.

360
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:35,690
Personal days,on the other
hand,are much more flexible.

361
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,630
Thank you,meredith.Th waselicio

362
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:41,440
hey,where's the steak sauce?

363
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,700
I the out.

364
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,090
I got some in my mivan somewhere.

365
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,210
Wait a second.

366
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,010
How does the steak factor in again?

367
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,680
I think she got it as a tip,but I don't
know why she didn't just take cash.

368
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,310
I don't care what she's doing.I
hope she just keeps doing it.

369
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,370
Amen,just keep the ribs coming.

370
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,490
