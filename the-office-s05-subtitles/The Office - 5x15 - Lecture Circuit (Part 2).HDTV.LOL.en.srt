00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:02,430
Previously on the office

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,070
I am on a lecture circuit.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
I'm going around to all the branches,

4
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:08,970
And i'm telling them my
secret recipe for success.

5
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,980
I have now memorized all of your names.

6
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:17,090
Shirty,mole,lazy eye,mexico,baldy.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,800
Then i turn it on and
i say,"prepare yourself

8
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,300
For the uta chain store massacre."

9
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,920
- How's jim?
- We're engaged.

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,350
Oh,my god,i'm so happy for you.

11
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,240
Oh,well...thank you.

12
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,230
You rember holly?

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,200
She used to work for h.R.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,130
She was the love of my life.

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,110
She just left,and i never got closure.

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,210
And i feel like i need to
go to nashuand get closure.

17
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,280
Okay. Let's go.

22
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,330
I didn't eat lunch.

23
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,510
I didn't eatallmy lunch.

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,420
Hello,everyone.

25
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,640
Oh,ice cream.

26
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,810
Nice,kevin. Looks good.

27
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:24,550
It...yeah.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,220
Angela,you're more chipper than usual.

29
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,500
I am proud to announce
that there is a new addition

30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,540
To the martin family.

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:34,220
She's hypoallergenic.

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,620
She doesn't struggle
when you try to dress her.

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,570
She's a third-Generation show cat.

34
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,830
Her father was in meet the parents.

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,210
Needless to say,she
was very,very expensive.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,760
- How much?
- $7,000.

37
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,890
For a cat? I could
get you a kid for that.

38
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,180
Where'd you get that kind of money?

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,610
I sold andy's engagement ring on ebay.

40
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,700
Wait,you didn't give it back?

41
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,820
He wouldn't have wanted that.

42
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,890
Her name is prinss lady!

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,940
- Seven
grand.- Mm-Hmm.

44
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,540
I gotta see that little bitch.

45
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,310
I have something better than a picture.

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,230
Come on.

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,460
You have your cats on nanny cam?

48
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:07,240
Yeah.

49
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,890
I mean,i usually try to take leave

50
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,850
When i get a new cat,

51
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,340
But i'm out of vacation days.

52
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,030
And this company still
doesn't recognize cat marnity.

53
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,320
I e meofanfi,cewhen somebody has
a kid,oh,sure,take off a year.

54
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,540
She's right. I had my second
kid just for the vacation.

55
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,150
Right. Anyways...

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,020
I just want to make sure princess lady

57
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,550
Is acclimating well.

58
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,590
She means more to me than anyone.

59
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,470
Anycat,you mean.

60
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,360
And person.

61
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,550
So detour.

62
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,970
We're now adding nashua
to the lecture circuit

63
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:41,070
So michael can confront
holly and get some closure.

64
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,860
Nashua actually sounded
very excited on the phone.

65
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,790
I don't think they
get a lot of visitors.

66
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,090
Because their offi is only accessible

67
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,190
By cross-Country
skis. Hey-Oh!

68
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:54,850
I've been driving too long.

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,680
- What did you do?
- Stop yelling at me!

70
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,910
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,060
What did you learn in there?

72
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,280
I t you learned things,huh?

73
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,410
Like how to fashion a shiv,hmm?

74
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,020
Hey,what the hell's going on?

75
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,100
D't you tell jim where you were

76
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,120
From ages 14 to 15.

77
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,840
I was kickin' it.

78
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,020
- In juvie.
- What?

79
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,390
Juvie...nile... detention center.

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,670
- Where they send teenagers
- Yep. Got it.

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,200
What did you do? Huh?

82
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,070
Hey,dwight,sounds like she was 14,

83
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,090
So maybe we wanna go a little easy.

84
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,470
If she's old enough to get married,

85
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,340
She's old enough to follow the law.

86
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,410
What did you do?

87
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,990
My boyfriend dumped
me,so i stole his boat.

88
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,240
I mean,he told me it was his boat.

89
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,700
It was actually his father's.

90
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,300
I just thought it'd be really romantic,

91
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,370
Likethelma and louise,but
with,like,a boat.

92
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,740
And it was the worst year of my life.

93
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,690
And i can't believe that
you guys are making me

94
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,610
Talk about this on my birthday!

95
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,630
I thought you saidyesterday
was your birthday.

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,070
Hey,you know what? I got you a cake.

97
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:55,040
You did?

98
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,000
I want to see the cake.

99
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,860
And...ta-Da!

100
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,650
I hate it.

101
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,210
How do you hate it? It's a cake.

102
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,090
Well,there's no
flowers or toys or--

103
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,790
I mean,there's nothing on it.

104
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,010
Where did you even find

105
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,390
I mean,it doesn't have my name on it.

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,670
Do you guys know what my name is?

107
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
- My name is kelly!
- Right.

108
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,710
I forgot if there was an "e"
between the "l" and the "y."

109
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,550
I still don't know.

110
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
I mean,i don't even
know what the theme is.

111
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,280
What's the theme?!

112
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,580
- Birthday.
- Frostg.

113
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,760
Those aren't themes.

114
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,480
There's always a theme.

115
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,060
There's always a theme.

116
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:39,500
Nice job on the cake,bozo.

117
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Okay,you know what,next time,

118
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,680
I'll let you get the cake,

119
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,970
Andiget to scream at the bir

120
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,660
Okay,a little bit more
closer to the sign.

121
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,790
Yeah.

122
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,860
- Do i look okay?
- You look good.

123
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,040
- Hi.
- Hi,can i help you?

124
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,410
Yes,you can.

125
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,220
I am michael scott

126
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:06,730
Regional manager of the scranton branch.

127
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,820
- Yes,we were expecting you.
- Have a seat.

128
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,490
Thank you.

129
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,220
Um...is holly flax anywhere here?

130
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,890
Actually,she on an h.R. Retreatfi

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,730
For the next three days.

132
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,090
She's not here?

133
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,080
But if you need to get in
touch with her immediately,

134
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,440
You could talk to a.J.

135
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,720
He's a salesman here.

136
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,690
A.J. Yeah,he's her boyfriend.

137
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,690
He's just over there.

138
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,790
She has a boyfriend.

139
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm so sorry,michael.

140
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,450
How could she do this toe,pam?

141
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,250
She's not doing it to hurt you.

142
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,420
I can't do the
presentation. I can't--

143
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,430
Just...oh...

144
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,300
Thinking about seeing him...

145
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,370
And...thinking about...

146
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,750
Him getting to hold her
and getting to kiss her.

147
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,000
It just--
Oh,god!

148
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,190
Listen,when jim was dating karen,

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,990
I didn't want to come to work.

150
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,710
It was awful. I hated it.

151
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,170
- I wanted to quit,but-
I know-- Please...

152
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,100
Come on,i'm going through something.

153
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay?

154
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:44,270
You know,when holly gets back,

155
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,330
Everyone'll tell her
what a great job you did.

156
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,600
And then she'll realize
what she's missing.

157
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,760
Andhen she'll move back to scranton.

158
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,000
And her boyfriend will die.

159
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,930
Yeah. Maybe.

160
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,610
Maybe. One step at a time.

161
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,000
You can do this.

162
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,620
I can do this.

163
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,080
I think there
could be snacks or--

164
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,620
Is that what i think it is?

165
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,020
Good god!

166
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,060
That one ugly cat is
humping princess lady!

167
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,680
No! Awesome!

168
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,710
Stop it,mr. Ash! Bad cat!

169
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,420
That is very bad. You stop it right now!

170
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,730
I swear,he is fixed.

171
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,120
Yeah,i know fixed. That ain't fixed

172
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,510
- No way.
- No,now listen.

173
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,050
You can't let what you see
here sully your image of them.

174
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,380
They are good,decent cats.

175
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,480
I've gotta go. I'll be back in an hour.

176
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,010
Oh,stop that! Oh!

177
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:45,050
Oh,the other one's watching.

178
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,530
Okay,so all we need is a theme...

179
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,620
And cups and ice and nch and a cake.

180
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,060
Busy.

181
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,900
Hey,what's that show that
she's always talking about?

182
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,250
My god,is this how you are with pam?

183
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,650
Because she must want to
shoot herself in the face.

184
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,810
You know what. I could
use a little help.

185
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,900
You know what. I'm a little busy.

186
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,650
We have a lot to do,

187
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:11,270
And you are putting up
a very effeminate sign.

188
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,290
Is that what you've
been doing,making a sign?

189
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,430
It's not effeminate. It's festive.

190
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,310
You've been makingthatsign for something

191
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,330
That we can just announce
to the whole office?

192
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,200
Hey,everybody,the party's now at 3:00.

193
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,070
I know,i just read it on the sign.

194
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,730
Good morning,

195
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,060
Viet--
Nashua!

196
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,410
Sales.

197
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:41,060
Sales is whatbwingsus together today.

198
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:46,260
How do we deal with clients who say,

199
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,800
"Frankly,my dear,

200
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,880
I don't give a damn about paper,"

201
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,000
And get them to show us the mone

202
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:57,230
Well,we are going to find out today.

203
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,100
Show of hands.

204
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,100
How many of you are salesmen?

205
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,070
Let's see the salesmen. Ooh,okay.

206
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,100
Well,i know what the
rest of you are thinking.

207
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,610
Wow,yuck. Salesmen are the worst.

208
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,510
They are awful. They are so arrogant.

209
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,720
They think the whole
place revolves around them.

210
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,610
Handsome. Good listeners.

211
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,400
Funny. Mr. Wonderful.

212
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,220
So,okay,you're a
salesman. What's your name?

213
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,490
- A.J.
- A.J.

214
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,340
What kind of name is a.J.?

215
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,050
What,do you race cars?

216
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,360
I'm a salesman. That's
why i raised my hand.

217
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,940
Ooh,ouch. Okay.

218
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,150
Good. You're funny.

219
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,930
Very good and funny. Tell me,a.J.,

220
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,880
Are u dating?

221
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,980
Is there somebody you date?

222
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,740
Yeah. Why,are you interested?

223
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,260
I have a question about
discounts from distributors.

224
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,840
Yep,we will get to you.

225
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,660
Okay,so you're dating somebody.

226
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,550
Um...is it serious?

227
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,940
It's pretty serious. Yes.

228
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,190
Does she ever talk about me?

229
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,070
Oh,god.

230
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,230
Excuse me?

231
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
What does this have to do with sales?

232
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,690
It's all connected. Shut up.

233
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,190
Does she ever mention michael scott?

234
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,700
No. What are you talking about?

235
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,900
Does it feel good?

236
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,470
Does what feel good?

237
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,550
Your life.

238
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,030
Oh,wow.

239
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,440
Ahh,legs are sort of giving out.

240
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,000
Long drive in the
car. So let's just--

241
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,980
We'll st continue.

242
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,680
Oh,wow.

243
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,290
Okay...

244
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,770
Michael,get off the floor.

245
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,140
Yeah,yeah...

246
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,650
I can't do this,pam.

247
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,220
Justead-- Just
read the cards.

248
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
Michael,you
have to--

249
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:57,170
No,i'm okay. I'm all right.

250
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,690
Okay...okay.

251
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,510
That was weird,huh?

252
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,730
It's all part of the presentation.

253
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,940
It was confusing,right?

254
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:23,730
Because confusing situations happen
to us all the time in our jobs

255
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,270
I'm just trying to bridge the gap

256
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,790
Between what just happened,

257
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,830
And the fact that i'm going to be doing

258
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,910
The rest of the presentation.

259
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,240
Sales is like a box of chocolates.

260
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,820
You never know which
vendor you're gonna get.

261
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,960
Forrest gump.

262
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:52,000
Blazer...freckles... penguin...

263
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,010
K.D. Lang... holly's boyfriend.

264
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,460
These mnemonic devices
help to make a connection,

265
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,080
And then also to help
you memorize names.

266
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,470
I have a chain saw!

267
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,850
Cutting down the competion.

268
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,800
Where is th bad cat?

269
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:24,190
Oh,you know who you
are. Excuse me,petals.

270
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,920
I'm looking for mr. Ash. He's a bad cat.

271
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,860
Bad,bad cat. Do you hear me?

272
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,620
Bad. Yeahyou were bad.

273
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,660
No,you look at me when i talk to you.

274
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,500
Do you hear me,mr. Ash? You look at me.

275
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,730
'Cause i'm talking to you right now.

276
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,370
This is getting weird.

277
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,350
Is she cleaning the cat with her tongue?

278
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,850
Ooh...

279
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,870
Has this been on the entire time?

280
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,210
I have no idea.

281
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,090
I was looking at pictures of food

282
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,270
On my computer.

283
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,940
Well,sorry i'm late.

284
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,810
I want to get that image out of my head.

285
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:40,830
The psychological issues

286
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,790
That go behind licking a cat

287
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,090
Are not things i want to go into.

288
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,620
Also,i'm prettyure she
coughed up a hairball.

289
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,990
Don't look up. Don't look up.

290
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,120
- Want some pie?
- No.

291
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,810
I went through holly's things.

292
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,370
What?

293
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,170
I stole the sleeve of her sweater.

294
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,170
Oh,michael.

295
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,440
I also stole something
off of her computer.

296
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:14,060
A document called "dear michael."

297
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,120
- You did what?!
- I shouldn't have done it.

298
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,660
It just-- I
couldn't help it.

299
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,320
- She never sent
it to you?- No,sh--

300
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,140
She didn't.

301
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:25,630
I'm gonna read it.

302
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,830
- No.
- Yes.

303
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,180
No,under no circumstances

304
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,920
Can you read that letter.

305
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,280
It's a violation of her trust.

306
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:33,560
How?

307
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,700
Because she didn't sent it to you.

308
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,740
I know,i know. You're right,you'

309
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,330
I could read it.

310
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,090
No,that
wouldn't--

311
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,630
Yeah,i could read it.

312
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,070
No,you don't have to do that.

313
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:52,060
- Go get your laptop.
- Okay.

314
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,240
What?

315
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,130
I'm not in love with her.

316
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,720
You have to write my
suggestions down too.

317
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,380
I'm not writing "horse hunt."

318
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,630
I don't evennow what that means.

319
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,540
It's in the name.

320
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,000
Okay,so far our ideal party consists of

321
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:20,040
Beer,fights to the
death,cupcakes,blood pudding,

322
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:22,230
Blood,touch football,mating,

323
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,630
Charades,and yes,horse hunting.

324
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,620
You're right-- Forget
horse hunting,it's stupid.

325
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,290
Look,is there a birthday that
you rember that you loved?

326
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,890
Here's one.

327
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,780
It was dark,warm,wet.

328
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:36,220
A sudden burst of light.

329
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,850
An intense pressure like
i'd never felt before.

330
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,200
Father,dressed in
white,pulls me forward.

331
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,800
- Mother bites the cord.
- Okay,stop.

332
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,820
Forever stop that story.

333
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,050
That's disgusting,and it doesn't count.

334
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,940
So give me another one.

335
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:51,440
Schrutes don't celebrate
birthdays,idiot.

336
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,360
It started as a depression-Era prac,

337
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,300
And then moved on to an esome tradition

338
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,630
That i look forward to every year.

339
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,470
What about you?

340
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,920
Actually,when i was seven,my dad took me

341
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,130
To the natural history
museum in new york.

342
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,770
And we looked at fossils all day.

343
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,500
And at the end of the day,he got me

344
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,760
A little plastic triceratops.

345
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,140
It was awesome.

346
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,000
That's cool.

347
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,930
Hey,you know what's even
cooler than triceratops?

348
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,290
Every other dinosaur that ever existed!

349
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,140
Didn't see that one coming.

350
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,390
It's deleted.

351
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,340
Well?

352
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:31,760
She still has feelings for you.

353
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,670
She said that?

354
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,800
Is that what it said? What did it say?

355
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,990
I can't tell you specifically,

356
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
But...it's not over.

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,100
You're sure?

358
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,140
Okay.

359
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,880
Happy birthday. Surprise!

360
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,100
Hey,it's not a surprise.
It's not a surprise.

361
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,480
This doesn't look good.

362
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,260
What?! You have a cake.

363
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,760
You have a delicious cake

364
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,680
With your name spelled correctly?

365
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,090
- Told you.
- You haven't heard our theme,though.

366
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,180
You don't hear a theme. You see it.

367
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,880
Why is there a chiclet on my cake?

368
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:24,960
That's the best part.

369
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,470
That represents a
pillow,or a television.

370
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,850
Our theme,if
you will--

371
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,520
Because the fun part
is you get to decide

372
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,620
On an hour of television
or an hour of napping.

373
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,740
That's our theme.

374
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,380
- Cool.
- Yeah?

375
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,850
I love it.

376
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,110
Oh,yes! Okay,good.

377
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,520
So what's it gonna be,kapoor?

378
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:45,460
Ooh,,can she pick a half hour of each?

379
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:46,220
- No.
- No.

380
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,340
Oh,then pick tv.

381
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:50,090
- Take a nap.
- Tv.

382
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,740
No,watching tv at work is really cool.

383
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,210
Take a nap.Nothing good is on right now.

384
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,260
Bonnie hunt is on.

385
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,260
You know,i have been
watching tv all week.

386
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,250
I choose nap.

387
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,070
All right. Okay,nap it is.

388
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,260
Everyone out. Get out!

389
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,590
We're gonna be eating cake atur desks.

390
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,540

391
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,000

You've got one hour.

399
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,920
I'm too excited to sleep.

400
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,250
Mm,great cake.

401
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
Thanks.

402

Birthday time is over!

403
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,600
Now go make up for
all the work you missed

404
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,490
When you were taking your nap.

405
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,500
Many happy returns.

406
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,450
I feel great.

407
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,250
So good to have closure. Ah!

408
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,790
We should go apologize
to roy or something.

409
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,450
No,we don't need to do that.

410
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,850
Who have i wronged? Who have i wronged?

411
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,080
Oh,oh!

412
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,410
What about that fat guy
from stamford that insulted?

413
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,420
We should find him.

00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,340
You mean tony.

415
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,420
