1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,300
HERE ARE OUR FINAL ACTUAL 
COSTS FOR THIS YEAR.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,000
OKAY.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,800
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE DID PRETTY WELL.

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,600
YES, YES, I CAN SEE...

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,500
THAT WE DID INDEED.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,700
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN THIS 
TO ME LIKE I AM AN 8-YEAR-OLD.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,900
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THIS 
IS THE OVERALL BUDGET 

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,000
FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR ALONG THE X-AXIS.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
YES. RIGHT THERE.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,700
THERE'S THE "X-AXIX."

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,700
YOU CAN SEE CLEARLY ON THIS PAGE THAT 

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,900
WE HAVE A SURPLUS OF $4,300.

13
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:32,900
??OKAY. 

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,500
BUT WE HAVE TO SPEND THAT 
BY THE END OF THE DAY

15
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,100
OR IT WILL BE DEDUCTED 
FROM NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,300
WHY DON'T YOU EXPLAIN 
THIS TO ME LIKE I'M FIVE.

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,200
YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY GIVE YOU $10 

18
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,900
TO OPEN UP A LEMONADE STAND.

19
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,100
SO YOU GO OUT AND YOU BUY CUP AND 
YOU BUY LEMONS AND YOU BUY SUGAR.

20
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,200
AND NOW YOU FIND OUT 
THAT IT ONLY COST YOU $9.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,800
- SO YOU HAVE AN EXTRA DOLLAR.
- YEAH.

22
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,600
SO YOU CAN GIVE THAT DOLLAR 
BACK TO MOMMY AND DADDY, 

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
BUT GUESS WHAT? NEXT SUMMER--

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I'LL BE SIX.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,800
AND YOU ASK THEM FOR MONEY, 
THEY'RE GONNA GIVE YOU $9,

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,000
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK 
IT COSTS TO RUN THE STAND.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,900
SO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO 

28
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,600
IS SPEND THAT DOLLAR ON SOMETHING NOW,

29
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,800
SO THAT YOUR PARENTS THINK THAT IT 
COSTS $10 TO RUN THE LEMONADE STAND.

30
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,800
SO THE DOLLAR'S A SURPLUS. 
THIS IS A SURPLUS.

31
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,400
WE HAVE TO SPEND THAT $4,300 
BY THE END OF THE DAY

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,800
OR IT'LL BE DEDUCTED 
FROM NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,900
WE SHOULD SPEND THIS MONEY ON A 
NEW COPIER WHICH WE DESPERATELY NEED.

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,500
OKAY, BREAK IT DOWN IN TERMS OF, UM...

35
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,300
OKAY, I--I THINK I'M GETTING IT.

The Office S05 EP10

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,700
GUESS WHAT, EVERYBODY?

40
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,200
CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY THIS YEAR.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,900
OSCAR VERY SMARTLY HAS DISCOVERED 
AN EXTRA $4,300 IN THE BUDGET.

42
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,100
THANK YOU, OSCAR.

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,000
AND I HAVE DECIDED WITH THAT 
MONEY I AM GOING TO BUY A NEW--

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,600
DRUM ROLL, PLEASE.

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,100
CAN ANYBODY GUESS?

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,200
- NEW CHAIRS?
- NO.

47
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,500
A NEW COPIER.

48
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,100
UNLESS EVERYBODY CAN 
AGREE ON SOMETHING BETTER?

49
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,500
NO, NO, PLEASE. PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.

50
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,000
YES, MICHAEL, NEW CHAIRS.

51
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,100
THESE CHAIRS ARE TERRIBLE.

52
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,300
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO 
GET NEW ONES LAST YEAR.

53
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
SO WE ALL AGREE TO GET 
NEW CHAIRS THEN. GOOD?

54
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,100
YEAH, HE SAID GOOD. I'M GOOD.

55
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,000
NOW LISTEN, WE ARE A PAPER COMPANY.

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,100
HOW CAN WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR JOBS 

57
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
IF WE HAVE TO PUT OUR FINE 
PAPER IN THIS WRETCHED MACHINE?

58
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,000
OSCAR, NO. THIS IS NOT THE TIME 
FOR ONE OF YOUR PRINCIPLED STANDS.

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,900
PAM, YOU MAKE MORE COPIES THAN ANYONE.

60
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,200
EXACTLY. THAT SHOULD TELL YOU 
HOW TERRIBLE THE CHAIRS ARE.

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
OKAY.

62
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,000
OKAY, GOOD SUGGESTIONS.

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
ALL GOOD SUGGESTIONS. UH, 

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,200
LET'S JUST DECIDE AND AGREE UPON ONE.

65
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,000
I'M WITH PAM. CHAIRS.

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,600
ALL RIGHT, SO TEAMS FORMING.

67
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,400
WE SHOULD REALLY HAVE THE 
OFFICE'S AIR QUALITY TESTED.

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,800
WE HAVE RADON COMING FROM BELOW.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,700
WE HAVE ASBESTOS IN THE CEILINGS.

70
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
THESE ARE SILENT KILLERS.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,500
YOU ARE THE SILENT KILLER. 
GO BACK TO THE ANNEX.

72
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,600
YOU'LL SEE.

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,200
- MICHAEL.
- YES.

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,700
I'VE TALKED TO MEREDITH, STANLEY, 
AND JIM ABOUT THE CHAIRS.

75
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,400
I KNOW THEY'RE WITH ME ON THIS.

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA GO WITH COPIER.

77
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,600
WHAT? JIM.

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,200
EVER SINCE PAM AND I STARTED DATING,

79
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,600
I JUST FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD ASKING 
HER TO MAKE COPIES FOR ME.

80
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,900
SO I MAKE MY OWN COPIES.

81
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,400
AND THAT COPIER SUCKS.

82
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
LET ME TELL YOU, I--

83
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,400
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

84
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,700
PAM AND I DON'T HAVE 
TO AGREE ON EVERYTHING.

85
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,200
JIM, GOOD FOR YOU STANDING 
UP TO PAM LIKE THAT.

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,900
THE BALLS ON YOU, MAN.

87
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,400
SO MICHAEL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

88
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,600
WHY ME?

89
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,600
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
WOW, OKAY. WELL,

91
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,000
I SWALLOWED ALL YOUR IDEAS.

92
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,700
I'M GOING TO DIGEST THEM AND 
SEE WHAT COMES OUT THE OTHER END.

93
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,100
DWIGHT, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT 
SOME OF THESE DIRECTIONS TO SCHRUTE FARMS.

94
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,500
YEAH, DO TELL.

95
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I MEAN, LIKE, "156 PACES FROM 
THE LIGHT RED MAILBOX, MAKE A LEFT."

96
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,600
"WALK UNTIL YOU HEAR THE BEE HIVE."

97
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,300
HOW COULD IT BE MORE CLEAR?

98
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,600
I THINK ANDY MAKES AN EXCELLENT POINT.

99
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,600
OKAY.

100
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,100
BUT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT 
THERE'S ONLY ONE BATHROOM.

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,300
WE'LL DIG A TRENCH.

102
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,700
AS LONG AS IT'S DOWNHILL FROM 
THE WELL, WE SHOULD BE FINE.

103
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,300
NANA MIMI CANNOT SQUAT OVER SOME TRENCH.

104
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,400
WE'RE GONNA PUT OUT STUMPS. COME ON.

105
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,900
LET'S THREE-WAY THIS LITTLE ISSUE 

106
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,100
AND COME TO A SOLUTION BY THE 
TIME WE GET TO SCHRUTE FARMS.

107
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,200
HOW'S THAT FOR A PLAN?

108
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED AT SCHRUTE FARMS,

109
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
NO MATTER WHAT.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,500
I HAVE LOOKED AT 12 VENUES.

111
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,000
I HAVE LOST EIGHT DEPOSITS.

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
AND I HAVE SEEN ANGELA NAKED ZERO TIMES.

113
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,000
I AM NOT LOSING ANOTHER DEPOSIT.

114
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,800
HEY.

115
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:54,300
SO, UM, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT 
THIS WHOLE CHAIR/COPIER THING.

116
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,600
I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER.

117
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
OH, PAM, I REALLY...

118
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,700
HATE THAT COPIER.

119
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,700
- YEAH, I KNOW.
- YEAH.

120
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,700
BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD RECONSIDER. 

121
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,600
BEESLY, ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

122
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,900
JIM.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,400
JIM, JIM, JIM.

124
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I'M NOT THREATENING YOU.

125
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
I LOVE YOU.

126
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,800
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

127
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,600
YOU'RE ON VERY DANGEROUS GROUND.

128
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
ALL RIGHT.

129
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,700
OKAY.

130
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,000
THIS IS WHERE YOU'LL HAVE 
YOUR RECEIVING LINE.

131
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,900
OF COURSE WE'LL CLEAR OUT ALL 
THE LIVESTOCK AND HAY INSIDE.

132
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,100
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

133
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,400
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

134
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,100
MANURE. GET RID OF IT.

135
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,400
MANURE COVERS UP THE SMELL 
OF THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE.

136
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,200
DO YOU HAVE TO SLAUGHTER 
ON OUR WEDDING DAY?

137
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,500
YOU WANT TO EAT, DON'T YOU?

138
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,400
HONEY, SAY SOMETHING.

139
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,100
DWIGHT, IF WE PAY EXTRA COULD YOU 
SLAUGHTER THE ENTREES THE DAY BEFORE?

140
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,800
I'LL CONSIDER IT

141
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,200
SEE?

142
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,100
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT!

143
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,200
MAKIN' PROGRESS HERE.

144
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,500
DARN!

145
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,600
THERE'S A HOSE OUT BACK. 

146
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,700
OKAY.

147
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
REMEMBER YOU WERE GONNA GET A NEW CHAIR

148
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,700
AND YOU WERE GONNA GIVE 
YOUR OLD CHAIR TO ME.

149
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,800
- REMEMBER THAT?
- YES.

150
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,000
- WELL, THAT NEVER HAPPENED. 
- MICHAEL.

151
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,900
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

152
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,300
I'M JUST GONNA GRAB SOME 
LUNCH. WANNA COME WITH?

153
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,500
REALLY?

154
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,700
ABSOLUTELY! YEAH, 
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

155
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,200
- WHOA, YOU GUYS GOING TO LUNCH?
- ??

156
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,700
- YES.
- MIND IF I JOIN?

157
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,000
- OH, GOD! YEAH!BEST LUNCH EVER!
- ??

158
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
LET'S DO IT. 

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,500
ALL RIGHT! COOL. 

160
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,400
- WHERE WE GOING? 
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

161
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,100
SO I GUESS THAT'S HOW 
THEY'RE GONNA PLAY THIS.

162
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,300
IT IS ON.

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
SO ON.

164
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,400
LOOK, I REALLY NEED THIS NEW CHAIR.

165
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,700
I MEAN SERIOUSLY.

166
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,600
HOW IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IN FIVE YEARS,

167
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:58,400
I'VE HAD TWO ENGAGEMENT 
RINGS AND ONLY ONE CHAIR?

168
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,200
MICHAEL.

169
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,400
MICHAEL, THAT IS HILARIOUS.

170
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
OH, IS SOMEBODY MAKING FUN OF ME?

171
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,900
THE BEST!

172
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
GREAT FRIENDS. THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

173

YEAH.

176
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,600
THAT'S COOL.

177
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,400

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,000

197
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
- THE BOYS DEPARTMENT.- NO.  

198
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
LOOK AT THE ASS.

199
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,100
CHECK OUT THE ASS.

200
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
- NO WAY!

201
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
YEAH!

202
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,700
SO I GUESS OSCAR AND JIM WERE TALKING 
YOUR EAR OFF ABOUT THE NEW COPIER, HUH?

203
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,900
- YES, THEY WERE.
- ?? 

204
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,600
THEY WERE.

205
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
HERE'S WHAT I WAS THINKING.

206
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,800
EVERYONE SITS ON A CHAIR EVERY DAY.

207
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,000
BUT NOT EVERYONE--

208
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,900
SITS ON A COPIER.

209
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,800
OR EVEN USES THE COPIER EVERY DAY.

210
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,900
- YEAH.
- YEAH, RIGHT

211
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,400
VERY VALID.

212
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,800
THAT'S IT.

213
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
ALL RIGHT! SEE YOU LATER.

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
- SEE YA.
- HOT TIE GUY.

215
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,600
WELL...

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,100
HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION 
ON THE BUTTER SCULPTURE?

217
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,000
NO, I HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT.

218
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
OKAY, COW,  GOAT, OR SHEEP. 
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

219
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,700
I WOULD LIKE A CAT.

220
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,100
CATS DON'T MAKE BUTTER.

221
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
I WOULD LIKE A COW BUTTER 
SCULPTURE OF A CAT.

222
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,300
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

223
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,400
- I'M TELLING YOU
- YES, IT DOES!
- ??

224
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,800
- I WANT A BUTTER SCULPTURE OF A CAT.
- ??

225
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,900
COW, GOAT, OR SHEEP.

226
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,300
WHAT IS THIS?

227
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,100
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE ALL ON 
THE SAME TEAM. IS IT--

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,800
DAMN, WHY IS THAT IN THE KITCHEN?

229
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
YOU MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER

230
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,400
CHANGING TEAMS BECAUSE WE WOULD--

231
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,800
WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

232
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,700
NO, COPIER'S GREAT.

233
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,600
YEAH?

234
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,800
YEAH.

235
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,700
- I HAVE MY COPIES.
- THERE THEY ARE.

236
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,800
AND I HAVE MY ORIGINAL.

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,700
YOU GOT IT.

238
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,600
- SO SUCK IT.
- OKAY.

239
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,600
OKAY.

240
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,800
MICHAEL, I BOUGHT YOU A HOT CHOCOLATE.

241
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,800
I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

242
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,500
OH, THANK YOU, MY DEAR.

243
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,700
WAIT, MICHAEL. LET ME 
OPEN THE DOOR FOR YOU.

244
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,000
OH, WELL, CHIVALRY IS NOT DEAD AFTER ALL.

245
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
OKAY.

246
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,300
THERE HE IS! THERE HE IS!

247
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,700
HELLO, HELLO. HELLO!

248
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,300
GOOD TO SEE YOU, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

249
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,000
YEAYAH! THERE'S THAT ASS.

250
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,500
HEY, HEY! YEAH, UHN, UHN!  

251
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,400
OH, DON'T TAKE IT AWAY!

252
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,100
I ALMOST CHOKED.

253
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,800
HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE.

254
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,700
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

255
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,700
SO...

256
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,800
WHY DON'T WE TRY THIS OUT?

257
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,100
WE'LL SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

258
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,200
GIVE IT A LITTLE TEST 
DRIVE. WHAT DO YOU SAY?

259
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
YOU PRETEND TO BE ANGELA'S FATHER.

260
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,400
YOU WILL PLAY ANGELA, AND 
I'LL PRETEND TO BE YOU.

261
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,900
THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT 
LOOKS LIKE WHEN YOU'RE UP HERE.

262
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,700
HELLO, I'M ANGELA MARTIN.

263
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,000
- I'M ANDY.
- I WORK WITH DWIGHT.

264
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,900
HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 
A WORD YOU'RE SAYING.

265
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,700
WHAT?

266
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,700
ALTHOUGH BORN JUST MINUTES FROM 
HERE, HE SPEAKS ONLY GERMAN.

267
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,000
CLOSED SOCIETY.

268
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,300
SO NOW AFTER THE READINGS 
BY ALL OF YOUR SISTERS,

269
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,700
WE WILL ARRIVE AT THE VOWS. SO CONRAD,

270
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,900
THIS IS A LITTLE TASTE OF 
THE CEREMONY, IF YOU WILL.

271
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,800
HE'S EXPLAINING WHY WE'RE 
HERE, WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

272
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,300
MAKING INTRODUCTIONS. 
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.

273
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,200
THEN HE'S GONNA HAVE ANDY 
REPEAT A BUNCH OF STUFF.

274
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
HE'S GONNA ASK ANDY TO PRODUCE A RING.

275
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,400
I HAVE, UH, NOW JUST 

276
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,600
SOME TWINE FOR OUR PURPOSES AND... 

277
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
YOU WILL PUT THE RING ON HER FINGER.

278
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,600
THEN HE'S GOING TO ASK ANDY,

279
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,300
IF HE WOULD LIKE TO MARRY ANGELA. 
AND YOU WILL REPLY "I DO."

280
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
AND HE'S GONNA ASK ANGELA IF 
SHE WOULD LIKE TO MARRY ANDY.

281
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,900
TO WHICH YOU WILL REPLY...

282
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,400
I DO.

283
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,600
AND THERE WE GO.

284
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,600
OKAY, AND THAT'S JUST 
ABOUT IT. MAN AND WIFE.

285
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
GOT A CALL ABOUT A PROBLEM UP HERE.

286
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,800
DID SOMEBODY CALL HANK?

287
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,200
HANK, THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

288
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
THE OFFICE IS AT A CROSSROADS.

289
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
SO THERE'S NO SECURITY PROBLEM?

290
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,000
YOU KNOW I HUSTLED UP THE STAIRS.

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,600
YES, I NEED YOUR SAGE ADVICE.

292
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,300
AND EVERYONE, WHATEVER HANK DECIDES, 

293
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,200
THAT IS THE DECISION.

294
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,000
THAT WILL RESOLVE THIS ISSUE.

295
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,900
YEAH, TAKE AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

296
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:46,400
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

297
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
YOU KNOW, IT'S NICE AND WARM UP HERE.

298
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
YES.

299
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,700
SO WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

300
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,700
OKAY, WELL, WE HAVE A SURPLUS.

301
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,900
IMAGINE THAT YOUR PARENTS GIVE 
YOU MONEY FOR A LEMONADE STAND--

302
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
I KNOW WHAT A SURPLUS IS.

303
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,200
OKAY, GOOD. GOOD.

304
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

305
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
SOME PEOPLE WANT TO USE THE 
SURPLUS TO BUY A NEW COPIER.

306
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,900
OTHER PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING 
ABOUT THE CHAIRS.

307
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,500
- IS THAT THE COPIER?
- IT IS, YES.

308
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,600
WHAT?

309
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,100
I WAS JUST THINKING. LET ME SEE A CHAIR.

310
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,700
- OKAY.
- YOU CAN TRY MINE.

311
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,800
THERE WE GO.

312
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,400
NOT MUCH LUMBAR SUPPORT.

313
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,300
NOW EVERYONE, BEAR IN MIND ONCE AGAIN

314
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,400
THAT WHATEVER HANK SAYS GOES.

315
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
HE IS AN IMPARTIAL THIRD PART

316
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
ONE THE ONE HAND, THIS COPIER IS VERY OLD.

317
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,800
YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF 
THE NEW COPIERS THEY HAVE.

318
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,500
YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT THEY DO.

319
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
SO THE COPIER.

320
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,000
- WELL, LET ME FINISH.
- ALL RIGHT, YES.

321
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
NOW THE CHAIRS.

322
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:00,700
THE CHAIRS ARE VERY 
WEAK.VERY WEAK CHAIRS.

323
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I COULD NOT SIT ALL DAY IN THIS CHAIR.

324
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
WELL, WHAT SHOULD I DO?

325
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
LET ME SEE THE COPIER AGAIN.

326
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,900
ALL RIGHT, GET OUT. GET OUT. IT'S--

327
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,600
DWIGHT,

328
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT I WANTED.

329
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,300
AND THEN 

330
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,500
BEING HERE WITH YOU AND 
THE GERMAN MENNONITE MINISTER,

331
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,000
IT JUST ALL FELT RIGHT.

332
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,700
I MADE A MISTAKE PICKING ANDY.

333
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,400
I KNOW YOU DID.

334
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE 
TAKEN CARE OF EVERYTHING.

335
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

336
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,600
WELL, MONKEY,

337
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,300
HE'S A REAL MINISTER. 
AND YOU SAID, "I DO"

338
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,900
AND I SAID, "I DO."

339
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,600
AND ANDY WASN'T SIGNING A RECEIPT.

340
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
HE WAS SIGNING OUR MARRIAGE 
CERTIFICATE AS-A-WITNESS.

341
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,800
DWIGHT, THAT DOESN'T COUNT!

342
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,900
YES, OF COURSE IT DOES.

343
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,800
NO, IT DOESN'T!

344
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,200
IT DOES IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA.

345
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,500
- ??
- MRS. SCHRUTE.

346
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
WE ARE NOT MARRIED.

347
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,600
WHA--

348
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
TAKE THIS THING.

349
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,600
MY-- 

350
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,100
IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU 
DON'T UNDERSTAND GERMAN.

351
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,500
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU 
TO TAKE IF FOR YEARS!

352
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,400
ARE WE, UH--

353
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,400

354
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,400
MICHAEL.

355
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,700
HEY, DAVID--

356
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,400
I'M SORRY.

357
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,600
I'M SORRY, I'M EATING TIRAMISU.

358
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,400
SOME OF THE CHOCOLATE POWDER 
JUST WENT DOWN MY THROAT.

359
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,600
I'M STOPPING NOW.

360
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,800
IS THIS WHY YOU'RE CALLING ME?

361
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,400
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO,

362
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,000
I'M CALLING--

363
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
I'M SORRY.

364
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,000
OKAY.

365
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,900
I'M CALLING BECAUSE...

366
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,400
WE HAVE A STUPID BUDGET SURPLUS AND PEOPLE--

367
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,000
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

368
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,100
YOU WANT ME TO WEIGH IN 
ON A MINOR BUDGET ISSUE?

369
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,300
NO, NO, NO. I WANT YOU TO MAKE 
THE DECISION SO I'M NOT THE BAD GUY.

370
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:56,200
IF I WERE YOU, I'D JUST RETURN 
THE SURPLUS AND TAKE THE BONUS.

371
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,800
THE WHAT NOW?

372
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:01,900
BRANCH MANAGERS WHO COME IN UNDER 
BUDGET GET 15% OF THE SAVINGS.

373
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
LIKE A TIP?

374
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,500
$645?

375
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,700
I HATE DISAPPOINTING JUST ONE PERSON.

376
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,200
AND I REALLY HATE DISAPPOINTING EVERYONE.

377
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,500
BUT I LOVE BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY.

378
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,300
YOU GO IN THERE WITH $645,

379
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,000
YOU ARE LITERALLY A KING.

380
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,800
???

381
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,400
OKAY?

382
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,900
SURE--NO, I CAN-- I'LL DOUBLE CHECK.

383
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,500
ALL RIGHT, ATTENTION EVERYONE.

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,700
LET ME CALL YOU RIGHT BACK. OKAY.

385
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,800
I HAVE MADE MY DECISION.

386
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,100
WE DO NOT NEED A NEW COPIER.
WE DO NOT NEED NEW CHAIRS.

387
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,000
THIS COPIER...

388
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
IS...

389
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,500
WORKING PERFECTLY.

390
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
THAT'S THE ORIGINAL.

391
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,300
PAM, WOULD YOU STAND UP FOR A SEC?

392
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,200
SEE HOW RELAXED I AM?

393
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,100
I LIKE THIS CHAIR.

394
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,600
OFFERS GOOD SUPPORT. IT IS 
ERKEL-NOMICALLY CORRECT.

395
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,100
IT'S A GOOD CHAIR.

396
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:24,200
I THINK WE'RE SPOILED BECAUSE WE DON'T 
APPRECIATE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE.

397
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,200
YOU THINK KIDS IN AFRICA HAVE CHAIRS?

398
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
NO.

399
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,100
THEY SIT IN BIG PILES OF GARBAGE.

400
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,400
DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE COPIERS?
THEY DON'T HAVE COPIERS.

401
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
THEY DON'T EVEN--

402
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,300
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE PAPER.

403
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,100
AND WE ARE SPOILED BECAUSE WE 
THROW OUT PERFECTLY GOOD TIRAMISU

404
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,400
BECAUSE IT HAS A LITTLE TINY HAIR ON IT.

405
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,800
MY POINT IS THIS.

406
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,100
I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT IN 
TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED

407
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,900
AND IT IS NOTHING.

408
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,500
DO YOU KNOW?

409
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
DO I KNOW WHAT?

410
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
I THINK YOU KNOW.

411
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,000
NO.

412
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,600
KNOW WHAT?

413
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,500
YEAH, KNOW WHAT?

414
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,300
DOES ANYONE HAPPEN TO KNOW 
WHAT 15% OF 4,300 IS? 

415
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,800
$645.

416
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
- MICHAEL'S A GENIUS.
- RIGHT.

417
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,600
WHY DID YOU SAY DOLLARS?

418
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
BECAUSE THAT IS HOW MY MIND WORKS.

419
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,600
WHAT'S 15% OF 200?

420
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,400
THANK YOU.

421
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,000
EVERYONE, MICHAEL IS RETURNING THE 
SURPLUS SO HE CAN KEEP 15% AS A BONUS.

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,800
WAIT, WHAT?

423
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,600
YOU CAN DO THAT?

424
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,200
HEY, MICHAEL,WHAT'S 394 TIMES 5,912?

425
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,000
LET'S SEE.

426
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,300
YOU'RE GONNA GIVE YOURSELF 
A BONUS OF $645 INSTEAD OF 

427
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
GETTING THE ENTIRE OFFICE 
SOMETHING IT REALLY NEEDS.

428
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,000
I DON'T NEED $645.

429
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,700
I ALREADY HAVE $645, MORE OR LESS.

430
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,100
- YOU'RE GONNA GET US A COPIER THEN?
- THIS IS STUPID.

431
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,700
- OR CHAIRS.
- SO, SO STUPID.

432
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,900
AND, GOD,

433
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,400
THAT'S MY PHONE.

434
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,000
- I DIDN'T HEAR A PHONE.
-TO BE CONTINUED.

435
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,400
NO, I DON'T--

436
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,300
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

437
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,900
I HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT DECISION TO MAKE.

438
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,500
WE NEED A NEW COPIER. 
WE NEED NEW CHAIRS.

439
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,900
AND I NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO KEEP 
THIS MONEY WITHOUT HAVING EVERYBODY HATE ME.

440
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,100
HEY, TUNA, CHECK IT OUT.TUNA SANDWICH.

441
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,700

442
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,400
WHAT--

443
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:22,000
NOW I HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF A LEGAL ISSUE.

444
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,600
WAS THAT HOT OR WHAT?

445
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,900
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE?

446
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,300
MICHAEL, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A 
DECISION. THE DAY IS ALMOST DONE.

447
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
LET ME JUST SAY YOU'VE BEEN PROMISING 
ME THIS CHAIR SINCE THE DAY YOU HIRED ME.

448
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,900
YOU ARE A SMART GUY.I KNOW 
YOU'LL DO THE RIGHT THING.

449
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,000
YOU THINK IT'S EASY?

450
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:41,900
IT'S YOUR JOB.

451
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,500
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DE?

452
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I AM GOING TO GET UP AND I'M 
GONNA BE OUT IN THE COMMON AREA.

453
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,200
BUT YOU NEED TO DECIDE.

454
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,500
OTHERWISE, I'M TAKING THE BONUS.

455
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,900
ALL RIGHT?

456
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,000
IT IS A CLASSIC MANAGEMENT TACIT.

457
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,200
YOU HAVE TWO SIDES, A DEADLINE.

458
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
YOU KNOW THAT NEITHER OF 
THEM ARE GONNA CONCEDE.

459
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU PUT THEM 
IN THE ROOM AND YOU JUST

460
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
- HEY.
- HEY.

461
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,600
HEY, WE'RE GOING WITH THE CHAIRS.

462
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,400
WHAT?

463
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
I JUST FIGURED I'D RATHER HAVE 
NEW CHAIRS THAN NOTHING AT ALL.

464
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
THANKS, MICHAEL.

465
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
GOOD WORK. I'M PROUD OF YOU.

466
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:17,900
MOTHER--

467
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,300
WHAT DID WE LEARN THIS WEEK?

468
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,500
WELL, ONE, THANKS TO ME,

469
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,700
MY TEAM IS MUCH, MUCH FASTER 
AT COMING TO DECISIONS 

470
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,500
THAN I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE.

471
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,000
NUMBER TWO, NEVER BUY A FUR 
COAT WITH A CREDIT CARD

472
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,700
UNTIL YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE 
THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT.

473
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:40,900
AND THREE, YOU SHOULD NOW THAT 
SOME PEOPLE THINK IT'S COOL 

474
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,600
TO THROW BUCKETS OF FAKE BLOOD ON YOU

475
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,800
AS YOU ARE WALKING OUT OF 
BURLINGTON COAT FACTORY.

476
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,800
TRUCE.

477
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
YEAH, I GUESS. I WON.

478
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,800
YOU DID WIN.

479
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,900
You Did Win.

480
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,700
ANYWAY, I'M GONNA NEED THREE COPIES OF 
EACH OF THESE, STAPLED AND COLLATED.

481
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,000
TOTALLY KIDDING.

482
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,100
