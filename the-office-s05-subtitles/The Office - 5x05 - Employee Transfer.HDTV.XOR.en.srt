3
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,810

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:10,920

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,880
inappropriate. 

13
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,090
thank you. 

14
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,710

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,140
gordon gekko. 

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,150
oh, from the insurance commercials. 

17
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,200
yeah. 

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,700
awesome. 

19
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,860
let's put a smile on that face. 

20
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,300
damn it, Creed!

21
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,880
I’ve been up since 4:00!

22
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,100
sweet 'stume, dude. 

23
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,150
who are you supposed to be?

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,010
Dave. 

25
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,340
cool. 

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,630
you are. 

27
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,630
a cat. 

28
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,610
we were looking for kitten. 

29
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,060
oh, hang on one second. 

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,070
Jim Halpert. 

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,680
hey. 

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,680
hey, New York. 

33
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,690
Happy Halloween. 

34
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,590
Thanks. 

35
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,540
my costume's getting a lot of attention. 

36
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:25,760
so apparently no one dresses up for halloween here. 

37
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,900
I wish I had known that before I used grease paint for my moustache. 

38
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,720
and I can't even take off my hat because then I’m Hitler. 

39
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,840
Wanna see a magic trick?

40
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,350
I’m gonna make a pencil disa-- 

41
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,100
disappear. 

42
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:55,850

okay, I think we are set. 

46
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,210
we have puzzles, string for cat's cradles. 

47
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,860

look at all this stuff. 

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,890
it's only seven urs. 

52
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,740
when corporate found out that we were dating, 

53
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,600
they decided they were gonna transfer Holly back to her old branch in nashua, 

54
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:34,870
new hampshire. 

55
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,720
Michael's taking a personal day to move me up. 

56
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,110
road trip!

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,710

59
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,860
oh, uh, copy that, breaker. 

60
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,860
those duke boys are at it again. 

61
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,220
hey!

62
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,890
do not touch my radio. 

63
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,960
we're not. 

64
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,680
kidding. 

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,390
we're not doing anything. 

66
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,470
it's been a weird week since we found out I had to transfer. 

67
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,150
Michael wanted me to quit and get some job here in scranton, 

68
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,380
and I said, "well, why don't you quit and get some job in nashua?"

69
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,460
and he said, "I asked you first. "

70
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,370
and I said "first" at the same time he did. 

71
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,790
and then I said "jinx. "

72
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,560
and then we never talked about it again, 

73
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,840
and haven't been back to the conversation, so. 

74
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:15,140
all right, everybody, I am out of here. 

75
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,520
Jim, you are in charge. 

76
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,460
oh, i'll walk you out. 

77
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:20,160
ah, you are quite the gentleman. 

78
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,360
you can let people go a couple minutes early if you want. 

79
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,600
all right, we'll see. 

80
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,020
no. 

81
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,400
I am off to New York. 

82
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,900
my brother pete from boston and my brother tom from new jersey are taking Pam

83
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:36,650
and I out for lunch to celebrate the engagement. 

84
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,750
or maybe to beat me up. 

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,950
I can never tell with those two. 

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,350
good morning, temp. 

87
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,830
good morning. 

88
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,280
good morning, dwight. 

89
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,570
thought i'd go casual today. 

90
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,300
good morning, everyone. 

91
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,300
good morning. 

92
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,840
hello. 

93
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,640
how you doin'?

94
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,890
how are you, Phyllis?

95
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,160
good. 

96
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,990
that's funny. 

97
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,560
take that sweatshirt off!

98
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:18,540
hey, buddy. 

99
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,450
Andy. 

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,310
remember when I jokingly yelled at you to take your sweatshirt off?

101
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,840
totally joking. 

102
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,990
but you should know those colors are sacred. 

103
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,210
not that I care. 

104
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,860
but if you're not a cornell man, mm-hmm. 

105
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,140
you probably shouldn't wear them. 

106
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,800
no, I get it. 

107
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,820
I totally understand. 

108
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:39,860
and I just want to assure you that I mean no disrespect. 

109
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,410
you see, I’m applying. 

110
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,940
come on, you think you could get into cornell?

111
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,540
well, if someone who barely out-sells Phyllis can get in, I should be fine. 

112
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,860
I’m sitting right here, dwight. 

113
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,970
I meant that as a compliment to you, Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy. 

114
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,070
cornell is a good school. 

115
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,780
and I want to better myself through higher education. 

116
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,150
if it makes Andy angry, so be it. 

117
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,540
I have to unpack this weekend, but maybe next weekend we go to the outlets!

118
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,280
cool. 

119
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
mike, you driving every weekend?

120
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,810
we're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. 

121
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,630
sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. 

122
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,270
it'll be fun. 

123
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,330
wait a sec. 

124
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,850
oh, I love this song. 

125
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:28,780
life is a highway I wanna ride it all night long

126
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:37,950
if you're going my way I wanna drive you all night long

127
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,870
ooh ooh ooh ooh if you're going my way 

128
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,250
hey ther e. 

129
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,240
ce so, uh, how do you think we're gonna do against penn this year?

130
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,270
nathan ford's arm looks pretty strong. 

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,570
well, he's had a pretty good season so far-- mm-hmm. 

132
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,800
stop saying "we. "

133
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,850
you did not go to cornell. 

134
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,800
okay, you're just doing this to screw with me. 

135
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:00,640
not so. 

136
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,000
cornell is an excellent school. 

137
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,270
without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. 

138
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,960
at least not modern cabbage. 

139
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,150
I know it's an excellent school, dwight. 

140
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
I went there. 

141
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,480
my blood runs big red. 

142
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,950
someday we'll both get together in comstock hall and just laugh about all of this. 

143
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,180
hey. 

144
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,470
hey, future baby sis!

145
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,410
how are you, tom?

146
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,420
- nice to see you. - I’m good. 

147
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,740
I asked tom and pete to come early so we could play a prank on Jim at lunch. 

148
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,290
pretty awesome, right?

149
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,220
I think they're into the idea. 

150
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,980
they're probably thinking, "that Pam beesly, 

151
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:43,280
"she's the coolest sister-in-law on the planet. 

152
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,080
she's the best. "

153
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,330
the absolute best. 

154
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,890
okay, so, here's what I’m thinking. 

155
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,640
I’m gonna say that before ceramics class I took off my ring. 

156
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,540
and then when I changed back out of my smock, 

157
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,830
it wasn't in my pocket anymore, and I lost it. 

158
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,790
that's perfect. 

159
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,490
you know what'd be even more hilarious?

160
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,850
remember that thing we did when Jim was in high school with his girlfriend?

161
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,950
right!

162
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,740
that would be hilarious. 

163
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,920
yeah, we should totally dog her about being an artist, never making any money. 

164
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,260
that is awesome. 

165
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,070
like she basically has a hobby for a job. 

166
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,750
oh, yeah. 

167
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:21,950
so, not the ring, then?

168
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,830
the-- the-- not doing the ring, then. 

169
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,670
I think this is better. 

170
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,430
- the other thing would get Jim. -this is nice. 

171
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,970
it's fun. 

172
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,740
okay, okay. 

173
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,110
oh, he hates it when we pick on his girlfriends. 

174
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,460
okay. 

175
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,340
they came up with that idea really fast. 

176
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,130
this trip is longer than I thought. 

177
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,960
yeah, it did look shorter-- aah!

178
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,310
I was having a nightmare. 

179
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,710
you were sleeping?

180
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,800
you were talking bore. 

181
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:57,790
was i?

182
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,230
really?

183
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,830
was I saying anything interesting?

184
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,290
not really. 

185
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,660
all right, what's the scoop?

186
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,950
how far?

187
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,480
four hours. 

188
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,730
almost halfway there. 

189
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,840
we're only halfway?

190
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:09,840
halfway!

191
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,070
okay, you know what I want to do?

192
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,670
I want to pull over and find a little bed

193
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,700
and breakst for when we meet in the middle. 

194
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,690
emphasis on the bed. 

195
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,620
and the breakfast. 

196
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,090
next exit isn't for five miles. 

197
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,300
let's check there. 

198
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,830
hey, guys. 

199
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,240
hey, how are ya?

200
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,480
good to see you. 

201
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,430
nice to see yo again, Pam. 

202
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:34,030
Pam, I haven't seen you in so, so long. 

203
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,740
all right. 

204
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,930
so now we can sit. 

205
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,300
and get comfortable. 

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,920
there's nothing out here, man. 

207
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:48,170
yeah. 

208
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,540
I don't know. I just. 

209
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,800
imagined a hotel right here. 

210
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,970
a pool over here. 

211
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,820
little breakfast place. 

212
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,620
with really good bacon. 

213
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,910
just-- 

214
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,900
here we go. 

215
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,580
fourth time's a charm. 

216
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,820
life's like a road where you just. 

217
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,810
it's one thing here and the next day back sometimes you deal with it

218
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,510
then you don't sometimes you do what you want it's out there. . . 

219
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,020
are you crying?

220
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,640
no. 

221
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,870
allergies?

222
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
no. 

223
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,090
d darryl touch you?

224
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,880
what?

225
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,650
no, darryl did not touch me. 

226
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,720
can we just keep going, please?

227
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,150
what's the matter?

228
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,140
oh, it's not gonna work. 

229
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,160
sure it is. 

230
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,660
- there's too much distance. - oh, no, no, no. 

231
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,380
it's gonna work. 

232
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,170
it'll be fine. 

233
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,500
Michael, we've only been dating each other for a few weeks. 

234
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,650
listen to me. 

235
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,770
- I like you so much. 
- I like you too. 

236
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,370
and I’ve dated almost four women last--

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,690
I’ve dated four guys last year too. 

238
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,710
not la-- no. 

239
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,300
in, like, the last ten years. 

240
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,430
I’ve dated almost four women. 

241
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,610
and you are so far above them it is stupid. 

242
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,240
oh, Michael, don't. 

243
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:16,930
don't. 

244
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,440
don't make it harder than it has to be. 

245
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,320
that's what she said. 

246
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,200
lly thinks that this relationship is over. 

247
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,900
well, you know what, I am not gonna give up that easy. 

248
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,490
I’m going to make this way harder than it needs to be. 

249
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,380
take that down. 

250
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,210
- excuse m - take. 

251
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,040
that down!

252
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,300
you know, I once dated a couple guys from cornell. 

253
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,440
the were really nice. 

254
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,330
they gave me a ride home. 

255
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,650
I seriously doubt that anyone from cornell dated you. 

256
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,750
it's pronounced "colonel. "

257
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,120
it's the highest rank in the military. 

258
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,210
it's pronouncedcornell!

259
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,400
it's the highest rank in the ivy league. 

260
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:58,390
Andy, let's just talk about this man to man after work. 

261
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,270
fine. 

262
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,220
yeah, good. 

263
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,600
- what do you say?
- okay?

264
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,610
can we-- good. 

265
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:07,050
that's big red bear!

266
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,080
that's a bobble big red bear!

267
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,730
god!

268
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:20,340
if you leave on friday by 5:00, you'll be rolling in at midnight at best. 

269
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
and then sleep in saturday. 

270
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,660
that only leaves us less than 24 hours before you have to go back again. 

271
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,100
okayokay. 

272
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,120
I will talk to you on the bluetooth the entire trip. 

273
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,470
so we're talking constantly all the way. 

274
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,050
i'll tell you everything that I see. 

275
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,520
everything that I pass by. 

276
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,540
things that I witness on the road. 

277
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,750
well-- maybe i'll see an accident one weekend. 

278
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,720
how long could we keep that up?

279
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,620
years. 

280
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,580
year yeah. 

281
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,800
years of just a few hours every weekend?

282
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,790
here's my wish. 

283
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,990
I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy. 

284
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
thank you. 

285
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,830
my wish has come true, incidentally. 

286
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,570
because you've met me and you are happy. 

287
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,200
clever, mike. 

288
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,010
so, Pam, how much money does an artist make e office after they leave art school?

289
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,150
yeah, not a lot of money in the arts, right?

290
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,650
that's not really true. 

291
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,720
there's a lot of things you can do with an art degree, actually. 

292
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:20,430
maybe Pam should pay the check by drawing a picture on this napkin. 

293
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,780
wow, that's-- that's a little rude. 

294
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,470
what's your deal?

295
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,510
hey, jushaving fun, Jimmy. 

296
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,230
yeah. 

297
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,930
right, Pam?

298
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,480
yep. 

299
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
you know what, I think we're a great couple. 

300
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,660
I think we are a classic couple. 

301
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,820
I think we're like romeo and juliet. 

302
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:46,870
I think we go together so wel we're like peanut butter and jelly. 

303
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:47,630
don't you think?

304
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,620
- I do. I think so. - well then, don't do it. 

305
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:52,060
please don't do this. 

306
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,430
hey, what's up?

307
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,800
I just thought i'd try you. 

308
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,350
I’m thinking about that story where you ran into the girl you used to babysit. 

309
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,510
I don't know what I’m gonna do!

310
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,230
please call me back. 

311
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,140
I’m not gonna be okay. 

312
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:03,940
- please. - you will. 

313
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,920
no, I won't. 

314
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,980
I’m not strong. 

315
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,320
i'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan. 

316
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,670
oh, god!

317
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,080
you might be inter what?

318
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,090
dwight. 

319
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,170
Andy, I’ve been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join?

320
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:27,500
the harmoniacs or the do-re-migos?

321
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:33,610
assuming you had the voice to be in any of them, it's irrelevant. 

322
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,180
because I called admissions, 

323
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,810
and it looks like I will be conducting your university interview. 

324
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,040
that's a conflict of interest. 

325
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:42,550
yeah. big one. 

326
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,040
so should I not let you in now, 

327
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,120
or do you want to do the interview, 

328
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,840
and then I won't let you in?

329
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,940
interview. 

330
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,840
excellent. 

331
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:57,530
when the hourglass strikes 3:00, 

332
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,050
then in the room whence employees confer. 

333
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,260
- what?
- the conferce room. 

334
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,770
okay. 

335
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
who are your role models?

336
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,260
if I had to put dwight's chances into a percentage, I would say he has none-percent chance. 

337
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,660
so. 

338
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,450
dane cook. 

339
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:22,140
jack bauer. 

340
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,260
and elI whitney. 

341
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,260
you're doing great. 

342
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:35,500
life is a highway I wanna ride it all night-- 

343
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,270
this is my niece, vanessa. 

344
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,480
she's a trumpeter. 

345
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,700
and. look at her. 

346
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,430
cute. 

347
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,010
that must be really fun for you and marcy, huh?

348
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,300
yep. she only knows how to play when the saints go marching in. 

349
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:51,120
I love that one. 

350
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,080
yeah, but. 

351
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:55,290
she doesn't think she's gonna be, like, a career musician, right?

352
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,010
here we go again. 

353
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,860
what is your deal today?

354
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:00,880
I’m just saying, how many famous trumpeters can you name, besides louis armstrong?

355
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,690
miles davis. 

356
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,670
- one. 
- chet something. 

357
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,340
half. 

358
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:04,960
the point is, Pam, that there are jobs. 

359
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,950
dizzy gillespie. 

360
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:07,100
also good. 

361
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,070
and there are hobbies. 

362
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,220
I love baseball more than anything, 

363
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:10,900
but you don't see me trying to get on the mets. 

364
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,610
you don't. 

365
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,540
pete, you couldn't make the mets. 

366
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,660
she's at pratt. 

367
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,240
you play jv baseball. 

368
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,570
will you lighten up a little bit?

369
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,000
I’m just calling it like I see it. 

370
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,950
I don't know if I’m going to make any money with art. 

371
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:20,780
Pam, don't worry about it. 

372
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,470
I mean, its a very competitive field. 

373
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,390
but I have a professor who says that I have a lot of promise. 

374
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:28,220
and if I don't try now, I never will, so. 

375
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,640
guys, what is going on?

376
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,580
we pranked you. 

377
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,210
it was Pam's idea. 

378
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,290
Pam was the mastermind. 

379
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,540
got you. 

380
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,380
that was killer. 

381
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,680
I was so close to blowing it. 

382
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,090
let's see how well you know your big red history. 

383
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,730
bring it who was cornell's eighth president?

384
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,130
dale raymond corson. 

385
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,430
mm, I’m sorry, that's incorrect. 

386
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:56,490
cornell's seventh president was, in fact, james a. perkins. 

387
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,010
comprehension skills sub-par. 

388
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,530
hmm, interviewing skills. 

389
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,140
sub-par. 

390
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,480
what are you writing?

391
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,710
you can't even give cornell your full attention. 

392
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,300
on the contrary, I’m helping cornell by evaluating their interviewers. 

393
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,240
nobody wants that. 

394
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,890
to happen. 

395
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,350
well, when they get my evaluation, we'll see if they're interested. 

396
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:21,930
applicant is attempting to blackmail interviewer, showing low moral character. 

397
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,540
interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process. 

398
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,760
applicant is wasting everyone's time with stupid and inane accusations. 

399
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,720
interviewer has suspect motives. 

400
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,470
applicant has a head shaped like a trapezoid. 

401
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,640
interviewer has turned off applicant's interest in cornell, 

402
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,200
and they are going to go to the vastly superior dartmouth. 

403
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,040
ever heard of it?

404
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,000
I think I have everything I need. 

405
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,280
I think I have everything ineed. 

406
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:49,910
you will be hearing from the cornell application department. 

407
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,010
you will not be pleased. 

408
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,080
Andyouwill not be pleased with the result. 

409
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,310
and your affiliation th cornell will end completely!

410
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,920
will end completely. 

411
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,460
that is all, sir. 

412
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,180
you may go. 

413
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:16,420
there's another dolly in the truck, mike. 

414
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,600
you could take more than that lamp. 

415
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:22,490
for the record, I wanted to go another direction. 

416
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:24,040
which was way better. 

417
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:26,160
well, i'll be the judge of that. 

418
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,410
what do you got?

419
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,170
okay, I lost my engagement ring in ceramics class. 

420
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,510
left it in my smock. 

421
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,220
I had this whole thing where I go back to class, wrongly accuse another girl. 

422
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,830
look, I even used makeup to put a ring around my finger. 

423
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,480
you can hardly see it. it's very subtle. 

424
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,470
that is good. 

425
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,160
thank you. 

426
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,460
truthfully, anything would have been bett than that prank. 

427
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,670
text message from my brother. 

428
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,660
"Pam cool. 

429
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:52,220
welcome to the family. "

430
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:57,160
hey, how 'bout at thanksgiving we prank tom about being bald?

431
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,370
this is the last of it. 

432
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,100
oh, that's mine, actually. 

433
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,810
um, maybe put it back in the truck. 

434
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,730
you're not staying?

435
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,100
you know, I have some things I need to do this weekend. 

436
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,220
I just rembered. 

437
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,040
so i'll just ride back with you. 

438
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,740
but you want me to put it back in the truck. 

439
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,040
i'll be down in just a second. 

440
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:18,320
Holly?

441
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,670
so, um. 

442
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,990
I think I’m gonna go back with darryl. 

443
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,340
okay. 

444
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,220
bye. 

445
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,380
okay, bye. 

446
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,270
the office I know it's hard, mike. 

447
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,330
breakups hurt. 

448
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,590
we didn't break up. 

449
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:15,130
looked like it. 

450
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:24,860
sometimes when I’m down like this, it helps to sing the blues. 

451
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,510
okay. 

452
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:34,240
that's a really pretty song. 

453
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:37,590
no, no, check it out. 

454
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,470
look. 

455
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,910
wanna do that?

456
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,770
okay. 

457
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,900
that's when you hit me with what's getting you down. all right?

458
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,500
all right. 

459
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,930
no, wait, you-- 

460
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:56,970
you supposed to-- never mind. 

461
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,310
yes!

462
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,970
yeah!

463
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,910
I thought i'd come in casual today. 

464
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,940
man, I’m hungry. 

465
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,890
anyone else feel like a beet?

466
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,940
where did you get those?

467
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,000
what, these?

468
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,390
bernard farms. 

469
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,650
best beets in the state. 

470
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,670
I see what you are doing. 

471
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,790
but I do not know where you are going with this. 

472
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,250
well, you will. 

473
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,040
as soon as you visit my new beet farm.

cornell.
