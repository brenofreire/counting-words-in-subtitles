00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:04,800
Dunder mifflin.
This is erin.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,400
He's not available right now.

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,300
Uh-Huh. 

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,800
Yes.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,900
Sure, i'll give him the message
when he gets up. Gets back.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,600
Michael had chicken pot pie
for lunch.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,700
Actually,
let me rephrase that.

8
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,300
Michael had anentire
chicken pot pie for lunch.

9
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,300
And-- Let me
be more specific.

10
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,000
Michael ate an entire family-Sized
Chicken pot pie for lunch,

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,700
And then he promptly
fell asleep. So

12
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:35,400
we're all trying to be very quiet
So as to not wake him up before 5:00 p.M.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,300
Which, actually,
should be in about...

14
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,700
ten minutes.

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,500
Okay, i'm gonna go in there
And change the computer.

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,000
Are you sure
you can change his watch?

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can do it.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,600
What do you need from me?

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,600
Normally, i don't condone
leaving early.

20
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,900
But i have an appointment
with the horse doctor.

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,300
How that horse became
a doctor, i don't know.

22
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,400
Nah, i'm kidding.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,800
He's just a regular doctor Who shoots your
horse in the head When its leg is broken.

24
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,300
Like clock work.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,000
Ohh.

26
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Oh, no.

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,900
Uh-Oh.

28
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,500
- What's so funny?
- You had to be there!

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,100
Oh, yay!
Geography joke.

30
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh, my-- Oh, wow.
Okay, all right.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,600

Yeah, we walk around, everyone
sees our faces, And we leave, right?

41
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,300
Wait, should i have
left the car running?

43
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Oh, don't get us wrong.
We like picnics.

44
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
Come on, who doesn't
like a picnic?

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,700
Tell 'em at happened
last year.

46
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,100
I had this huge spider
in my baseball mitt.

47
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,800
No, no, that guy
who hit on me.

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,100
Oh, right, some drunk guy
hit on pam last year.

49
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,000
Said he was grabbing her
for balance.

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,700
Yeah, you don't grab these
for balance.

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,400
Well...

52
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,100
i'm gonna say 30.

53
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:37,700
40.

54
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
Insect repellant, which we clearly need,
Reduces the effectiveness of spf.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Good point,
but thought of that already.

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,300
Combination spf/repellant.

57
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,000
- Whoa. Homemade?
- Of course.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,300
You think the epa would ever
allow that much deet?

59
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,900
Rolph is my best friend.
We met in a shoe store.

60
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,200
I heard him
asking for a shoe

61
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,600
That could increase his speed
and not leave any tracks.

62
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,500
Michael, isn't that holly?

63
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,300
We're just friends.

64
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Hey, hey!
Wait a second.

65
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,500

66
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,100
Oh, no.

67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,900
I see they're letting
just anybody in here.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,700
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,000

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
So would you guys

75
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
Or one of you?

76
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,100
Or both of you.
Either or.

77
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,300
The combinations
are endless.

78
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
- Lemonade sounds great.
- Okay.

79
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,500
I'd love an iced tea,
actually.

80
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,300
You can go to hell.

81
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm kidding!

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,700
Um, sure, i will get you
the best iced tea in the world.

83
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
I lied to kevin.

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,900
Holly and i
can never be just friends.

85
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,800
I wrote down a list
of bullet points

86
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,600
Why holly and i should
be together,

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,200
And i'm going to find
the perfect moment today,

88
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,600
And i'm going to tell her.

89
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,600
Number one:

90
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,100
"Holly, you and i
are soup snakes."

91
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,000
The-- And the reason is...

92
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:24,200
because, in terms
of the soup, we like to--

93
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,800
That doesn't make any sense.
We're soul mates.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,900
Holly and i are soul mates.

95
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,400
Jim, pam.

96
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,700
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, charles.

97
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,200
- Nice day, huh?
- Yeah.

98
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,800
Must be nice to get a rest
from all your rest.

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,200
I don't get it.
He's not even my boss anymore.

100
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
Do you want me
to beat him up for you?

101
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,500
No, i shouldn't have to ask you
To do stuff like that.

102
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,700
You should just do it.

103
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,500
Listen up, everyone! I've gone
overhis lineup very carefully.

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,000
We cannot forget the humiliation
we suffered Last year

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,400
at the softball game With jim's
whole spider-In-The-Mitt incident.

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,300
Right?

107
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,100
Well, i could have died,
so...

108
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
i looked it up online
afterwards.

109
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
Erin, back row.
Ryan, you move up a w!

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,700
Bro-Migo,

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,500
You think you could put
erin on my row?

112
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,100
Why?
I don't understand.

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,100
If-- No, wait.
W- Wait a minute. I get it.

114
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,400
You want her to set you up
So you can spike it.

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Uh...

116
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:21,700

I'm gonna do you one better.

117
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,800

120
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900

122
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,500
What is up
with you two, holly?

123
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,200
Um, not much.

124
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,300
We're designing a house.

We should actually rehearse.

00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,800
Okay, yeah.

- I could have gotten that, idiot! It's not a sledgehammer.
- Can you see things with your eyeballs?

157
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:05,000
Come on, people.
We need to get our heads in the game.

158

Phyllis, why are you
sitting on the ground?

161
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,300
We've been out here

162
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,300

167
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,400
Ball is ours.

Hey, do you know if you're

171
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Or do you even know? What hand
do you use to answer the phone.

172
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,800
Back off, dwight.

173
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,600

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,800
What?

176
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,500
Maybe i played a little
in junior high.

177
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,500
And in high school.

178
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,000
Maybe a little in college.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And went to volleyball camp
most summers.

180
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,200
- ?? Yeah! We win.
- Nice job, beesly.
- We advance to the next round!

181
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,300
Oh, lord in heaven.

182
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,200
Had to be
part of the group.

183
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,300
I brought
some snacky snacks,

184
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,500
In case we get hungry.

185
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,600
Ooh, yes, please.

186
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,800
So what do you have
planned for us today?

187
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,500
- Hmm?
- What?

188
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,300
Do you have a script
for the sketch, or...

189
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,700
um...no.

190
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,300
I just thought
we'd wing it.

191
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,500
That cool?

192
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Crystal cool.

193
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,000
- Hit it, andy!
- Bump, i bumped it!

194
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
- Set.
- Don't set it to yourself.

195
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Yeah!

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Ow, my ankle!

197
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
- What happened?
- I...twisted it.

198
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,100
You weren't even moving.

199
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,900
Okay, sub!

200
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,100
I can play.

201
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,800
Is there a...
meredith here?

202
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah! Man in!

203
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,400
Rolph, did you
not hear me?

204
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,600
I don't hear cheaters,
tramps,

205
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,900
Or women who break
my friend's heart.

206
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,700
Let's go!

207
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,200
We could do a movie...
sort of thing.

208
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,800
- We couldo back to the future.
- Oh!

209
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,500
We have to convince dunder and mifflin
To go back in time...

210
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,200
fix their parents.

211
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,000
Can we get a delorean?

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,100
Jaws.

213
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,500
They swim in the ocean,
And they terrorize the whole community.

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,100
dun-Der, dun-Der

215
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,400
Dunder, dunder,
dunder, dunder

216
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,500
- We haven't found our great idea yet.
- No. No.

217
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,200
- We're circling it.
- Hmm.

218
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,400
Nicely done. We're still
gonna crush you, though.

219
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,300
- Yes, we are.
- You suckers are goin' down!

220
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,900
They're gonna wipe their asses
with your serves!

221
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,600
- Piss all over your faces!
- Okay, rolph, rolph.

222
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
It's true!

223
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,700
Ah, this reminds me of
the h.R. Convention last fall.

224
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Oh, yeah,
with bernie and efrem.

225
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
That was hilarious.

226
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,800
- Really, really funny.
- Really funny.

227
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
Listen, guys,

228
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,700
one more point,
And we play corporat.

229
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,600
Settle down, gentlemen.

230
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Good game!

231
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,600
Welcome to the 43rd annual
company picnic, everybody.

232
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,000
Thanks for being here.

233
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Now a couple of ployees have
volunteered To entertain us with a song.

234
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,800
Uh, it's a sketch now.

235
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,100
Okay, introducing
scranton's michael scott

236
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,400
Performing with nashua's
holly flax.

237
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
I have not seen this.

238
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,400
And now, presenting...

239
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,400
slumdunder mifflinaire!

240
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,700
Are you ready to play
slumdunder mifflinaire?

241
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,100
Yes, i am!

242
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
For $100.

243
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,900
Where did dunder
meet mifflinthe

244
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,000
"A," on easy street.

245
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,000
"B," a tour
of dartmouth college.

246
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,600
"C," they never met.

247
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,000
"D," brushing their teeth.

248
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,600
Ohh...i'm thinking.

249
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
I'm going to say...

250
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,400
"b,"
tour of dartmouth college.

251
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,300
That is correct!

252
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,300
How did you know that?

253
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,000
I was there!
Aah!

254
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I was a tour guide
at dartmouth college!

255
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,600
Noooo-Ho-Ho!

256
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,000
Nice campus.
Think you'll get in?

257
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,700
Yeah, i'm definitely
gettin' in.

258
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm a shoo-In.

259
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm robert dunder.

260
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm robert mifflin.

261
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,600
Robert mifflin
had a great life.

262
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,000
But unfortunately,
had undiagnosed depression,

263
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Which over nine million
americans suffer from,

264
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
And is ??

265
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,000
For $250,

266
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,100
How did he kill himself?

267
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
"A," a rope.

268
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,100
"B," a knife.

269
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
"C," a gun.

270
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,400
"D," brushing his teeth!

271
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,800
$250...

272
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,500
is more money than i've ever
seen in my life.

273
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,300
I will say 

274
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:56,900
"c," a gun.
He shot himself... in the head.

275
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,100
That is correct!

276
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,900
Yes!

277
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,500
I usually
don't enjoy the theater.

278
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,800
But this is delightful.

279
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,300
The economic downturn
has been difficult recently,

280
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,700
Forcing the closures
of both camden and yonkers,

281
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,200
To be followed soon
By what other branch?

282
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,300
For $500,000,

283
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,800
Is it, "a," scranton?

284
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,100
"B," buffalo?

285
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,300
- "C," utica?
- What?

286
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,500
Or "d," toothbrush?

287
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,100
I will say "b," buffalo!
Final answer!

288
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,200
That is correct!

289
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,700
What is he talking about?

290
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,800
- How did you know that?
- David wallace told me!

291
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,200
David, is this true?

292
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Okay, everyone,
we're at a picnic today.

293
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Are we losing our jobs
or not, david?

294
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
- They didn't know?
- I guess not.

295
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,400
I'm sorry, this certainly wasn't the time
or the place To announce thisort of thing.

296
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
But there have been talks...

297
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,200
about closing
the buffalo branch.

298
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
And...

299
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,200
we're-- We're closing
the buffalo branch.

300
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,200
You've gotta be kidding me!

301
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,200
- Are you serious?
- You've gotta be kidding me!

302
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
We're the best branch
in the company!

303
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,700
I can't believe it.

304
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,900
How could you
possibly think

305
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:16,300
That the right way
to announce a branch closing

306
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,600
Was in a comedy sketch
at the company picnic?

307
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,300
Well...i didn't know
they didn't know.

308
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,900
What about the fact
that they're here today?

309
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,100
- What about that?
- That didn't throw up any alarms?

310
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,100
No, michael need a little bit
for his comedy sketch,

311
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
And he thought, "oh, this
would be really funny."

312
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,200
- Thank you.
- Damn it, michael.

313
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
I told you that
in confidence.

314
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,700
Now i have to go over and deal
with these employees And their families.

315
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:41,200
A little boy just walked up to me and said,
"Is my daddy gonna have a job by christmas?"

316
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,500
Well, he'ju thinking
about his own gifts.

317
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,500
Maybe we shouldn't play
due to the circumstances.

318
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,300
Hey, people need volleyball
now more than ever.

319
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,700
How do you figure?

320
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
Because if we don't play,

321
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,300
Then the other team wins.

322
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,700
Dwight's right.

323
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,800
Corporate deserves
to get its ass kicked.

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,600
Let's do this.

325
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,100
Jim, come on!

326
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,500
Look who just woke up!

327
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,100
Uhh!

328
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,200
I been up for a while!

329
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,000
It's six to six.
It's a nail-Biter.

330
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,300
kav   Seven

331
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Now it's seven-Six. Or is that
too much accounting for you?

332
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,500
Here's an accounting
question for you.

333
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,200
What does one fiance
plus one lover equal?

334
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,700
?? One whore.

335
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,400
Okay, knock it off,
rolph.

336
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,200
What? She's sitting there,
casting aspersions--

337
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,600
Rolph, please.
I am asking nicely!

338
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,300
- Rolph, leave it alone!
- ???

339
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,700
- There you go.
- You got it.

340
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,800
???

341
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,000
Boo-Yah!

342
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Get it!

343
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
- I got it!
- Pam!

344
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,400
- You all right?
- Yeah.

345
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,400
No, no, no, i'm fine.

346
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,600
- You sure?
- Yeah.

347
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,600
- easy???
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

348
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,300
You wanna get that
looked at.

349
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,300
No, no, it's fine.
Just give me a second.

350
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,400
I don't know. You know,
this is a company picnic,

351
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
So, technically,
that is a company injury. You know, 

352
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,200
safest thing to do
is get that examined. Right, david?

353
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,600
- Yeah.
- All right, you know what?

354
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,100
You're justrying to get rid
of our best player.

355
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,300
Oh, jim, you're putting a volleyball game
In front of your fiancee's health.

356
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,400
No, uh--

357
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,100
Look, seriously.
I can move it fine.

358
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,900
Come on, let's go.
It's our ball. Let's go!

359
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,100
- I don't kw.
- Yeah, i don't think we can
let you play with that foot.

360
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,100
Come on. Tell you what. I spotted a small
hospital A few kilometers south of here.

361
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,300
Get her back as soon
as possible. I'll stall 'em.

362
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
I guess that's it
for you, jim.

363
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,100
All right, you know what?

364
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,900
???Come on, all-Black.

365
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
We'll be back!

366
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,700
Oh, man!
I'm so mad that pam got hurt!

367
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,700
Argh!

368
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,200
Rrrah!

369
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,200
I'll get it.

370
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,000
Probably shouldn't ve
mentioned buffalo.

371
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,900
Hindsight.

372
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,500
Should have had hindsight.

373
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,000
How do you think it went
before the buffalo thing?

374
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
I think it went well.
I think it was good.

375
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,400
There weren't any laughs.

376
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,200
No, it was
a tough audience.

377
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,900
Yeah, but we wrote it Specifically
for this audience.

378
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Believe me, I have seen a lot
of tough audiences in my time,

379
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,000
And that was one of them.

380
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Well, i'm glad we did it.

381
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,000
Me too.

382
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,900
We have a lot of good material
For next year's sketch.

383
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I can't wait.

384
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
Yeah, she's with the nurse
right now, So you'll have to stall

385
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,700
No, don't send in
the subs yet.

386
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,200
Dwight, i don't know.
Think of something.

387
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Well, to be safe,
we should do an x-Ray.

388
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,600
How long will that take?

389
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:15,600
Oh, it shouldn't be too bad.
It's a slow day. So...

390
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
no other radiation
this year? No metal plates?

391
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,600
No chance you're pregnant?

392
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,200
I'm sorry, could we just
hurry this up?

393
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
I' got a game
to get back to.

394
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh, good, because my next question was
Do you have a game to get back to?

395
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,100
What'd you think?

396
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
I loved it.

397
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,300
You know, there was a part near the end
That seemed like that went on a little long. But...

398
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,100
well, you guys
should hit the road before...

399
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,300
i close down
another branch.

400
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,900
Okay. So good to see you.

401
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,100
Good to see you.

402
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,500
- Aj.
- Michael.

403
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,300
I didn't find the perfect
moment, Because i think 

404
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,500
that today Was about
just having today.

405
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,500
And i think that we
are one of those couples

406
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,000
With a long story

407
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
When people ask
how we found each other.

408
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
I...

409
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,600
will see her...

410
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,600
every now and then. And...

411
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,700
maybe one year,
she'll be with somebody,

412
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,000
And the
i'll be with somebody.

413
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
And it's gonna
take a long time...

414
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,400
and then it's perfect.

415
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,400
I'm in no rush.

416
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,200
- Ha!
- Dwight, come on, now.
It's time to put in the subs.

417
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,800
Yeah, it looks like pam
won't make it back.

418
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,300
- Okay?
- Okay, fine.

419
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
All right!
Come on.

420
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,400
Except, you know what?
It's not fine.

421
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,500
How many people need to get hurt
Before we learn a valuable lesson?

422
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,900
One? Two?

423
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,500
