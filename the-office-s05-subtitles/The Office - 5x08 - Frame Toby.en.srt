1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,600
Are you
swallowing them whole?

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:08,600
You're eating them
so fast,

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,300
Are they even touching
your tongue?

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,400
Yes.

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,600
Brownies, is it?
Humph.

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,500
Pastry cubes
made of sugar and fat?

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,200
No, thank you.
I'll stick with my jerky.

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,200
So why'd you come in here?

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,900
To socialize.
And inform.

10
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,000
Ooh, brownies!

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm taking two

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,700
So I can parcel them up

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,400
And eat them...
at my leisure later on.

14
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,500
Much healthier.

15
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,400
You taking two?

16
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,200
Yeah, um...but one
of them is for Toby.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,500
Yeah. Why don't you
send that to him in Costa Rica?

18
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,300
Um...I'm just gonna
hand it to him right now.

19
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,800
Okay, weirdo.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
Why's that?
Why's that weird?

21
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,400
She said she was gonna
give it to him right now.

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,600
She's probably going to

23
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,000
Because they sit next
to each other.

24
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,100
Yeah, they used to.

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,900
Toby works here again.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,400
Oh, can you imagine?

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,900
Oh, no!
You don't know.

28
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,000
I don't know.
What?

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,500
You should probably
just meander back there,

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,100
Take a look,see if he's--
See if he's back.

31
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,100
Dare I?

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,000
You know what?
I'm going to.

33
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,400
For old time's sake.

34
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,600
Great practical joke,Jim.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,000
Got me to go to the annex.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
- Hi,Mi--
- No! God!

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,400
No,God,
please no!

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,600
No! No!

39
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,300
Nooo!

43
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,100
Look at him.

44
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
With his stupid face.

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Stupid...tan.

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,800
- He looks great.Well-Rested.
- No

47
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,900
He looks worse.

48
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,200
Michael, is everyone okay?

49
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,200
Ohh. Well,I'm afraid not.

50
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,600
Toby Flenderson of H.R.
has made a sudden reappearance.

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,400
I don'understand.
Is anyone hurt?

52
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:33,100
Not on the surface, no.

53
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,000
But I can tell...

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,800
People are disturbed,
David.

55
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Michael, you texted me
911-- Call me.

56
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
- Yes.
- All in caps.

57
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Do you know what 911 means?

58
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:46,300
I learned a while back
that if I don't text 911,

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,900
People will not
return my calls.

60
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
Um...but now people
always return my calls,

61
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,400
Because they think that
something horrible has happened.

62
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,700
Now, what I'm curious about

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,900
Is how you were able
to go an entire week

64
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,000
Without knowing a member
of your staff was there

65
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,600
I did not want
to go back to the annex

66
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
Because that is where
Holly worked, whom I loved.

67
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Also it's icky
back there.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
That's true.
People say it's icky.

69
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
Okay.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have to go.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
- David, wait.
- No.

72
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Is there no way
we can get rid of him?

73
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,600
Not without cause,
Michael.

74
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,100
I have cause.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,300
It is because I hate him.

76
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,000
You have to get along
with Toby.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,300
- No.
- Yep.

78
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
I don't.

79
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,400
Good-Bye,Michael.

80
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Don't do that.

81
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,800
Oh, come on!

82
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,600
Do you see this?

83
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,800
Disgusting.

84
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,700
So,Tunes, you still gonna
buy your old man's place?

85
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Yeah. I am.
Wait.

86
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,200
How do you know that?
I didn't tell you that.

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,500
Uh...no,I was just
walking by your desk.

88
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,800
I saw some emails.

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,000
I got peepers
of an eagle.

90
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,300
That's really not cool.

91
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,100
So Jim, you're gonna live
in the same house

92
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,100
That you used to pee
the bed in?

93
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,600
Yeah. I guess technically,
Kev, you're right.

94
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,600
Today's a big day.

95
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,700
Today's the day that I show Pam
the house that I bought for us.

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,500
Without telling her.

97
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,400
But it's my parents' house,
the house I grew up in.

98
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
And, yeah,I bought it
kind of impulsively.

99
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
I mean, the price was good,

100
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,700
And I was helping out
my Mom.

101
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,500
It's got shag carpets.

102
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, you can't blame
my parents-- It was the '70s.

103
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,300
And why would you wanna buy
ugly wood from trees

104
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:40,100
When you can have paneling and
a painting of some creepy clowns

105
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,900
That is apparently crucial to the
structural integrity of the building?

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,400
She's gonna love it.

107
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,100
Right?

108
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,300
Would you guys
all do me a favor

109
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,400
And just not talk about this
until I tell Pam?

110
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,400
- That'd be great.
- Whoa!

111
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
You haven't told
the missus about the castle?

112
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
You're in for
a spanking, my friend.

113
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,700
Myself and my lady--
No secrets.

114
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,300
Jim, don't listen to Andy.

115
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,000
I think it's romantic.

116
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,300
Oh, thanks,Phyllis.

117
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,500
Where's your place?

118
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,500
Oh, it's on Linden Ave.,
by the Quarry.

119
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,300
Oh...

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,600
Cool beans, man.

121
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,800
I live by the Quarry.

122
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,300
We should hang out by the Quarry
and throw things down there.

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,100
Definitely, we should.

124
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,600
"To whoever made
the microwave mess"

125
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,000
"The microwave
is a shared kitchen appliance.

126
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,900
"By not cleaning it up,

127
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,400
"You are basically telling whoever follows

128
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,100
"That their time
is less valuable,

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,700
"As they will have to scrub
out your disgusting splatter.

130
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,400
Sincerely, disappointed."

131
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,800
That is just obnoxious.

132
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

133
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,800
Wait, what?
The mess or the note?

134
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,900
The note.
So holier than thou.

135
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I liked it.

136
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,300
Don't you think the person who
left the mess is the obnoxious one?

137
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,200
No...

138
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,600
The note is way more
obnoxious than the mess.

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
"Sincerely, disappointed."

140
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,500
Get off your high horse,
richy.

141
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,900
Just because someone likes things clean
doesn't mean they're rich.

142
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,300
Nah.
They're rich.

143
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
You wanna see some
real high-Caliber acting?

144
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
Well,Mr. Kurt Russell,
you are about to be served.

145
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Hey,Toby.

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Great to have you
back, man.

147
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,700
Seriously.
Just, uh...

148
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Just a real pleasure
to see you again.

149
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,300
Yeah, thanks,Michael.

150
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,600
You're welcome.
Missed you.

151
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,700
Missed you
as part of our family.

152
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Well, that's--
That's-- Sweet.

153
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,400
I missed you guys too.

154
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,900
So Costa Ric
that was...

155
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,100
Did you have fun?
That must have been fun.

156
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Well, um,
it was amazing.

157
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,300
Really was.
Thanks for asking.

158
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,300
- Um..beaches were pristine.
- Nice peaches?

159
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,100
- Pristine beaches?
- Yeah, uh...

160
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,300
The whole thing
was incredibly cathartic.

161
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
Why'd you come back?
Why didn't you stay?

162
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
Well, it's actually kind of
hard to meet people out there.

163
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,600
I bet.
For you.

164
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,600
And, uh. Yeah.
Plus, it was hot.

165
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,900
- Hot.
- Why didn't you get an air conditioner?

166
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,700
Should have gotten
an air conditioner for yourself.

167
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,700
Are you all right,
Michael?

168
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah,I am.
I am.

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,700
I tried.
I tried.

170
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,900
I tried to talk to Toby
and be his friend,

171
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,100
But that is like trying
to be friends with an evil...snail.

172
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,700
I feel like
I'm dyin' inside.

173
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,500
I feel like neve campbell
inscream II.

174
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
She thinks she can
go off to college and be happy,

175
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,800
And then...
the murder comes back

176
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,500
And starts killing off
all of her friends.

177
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,600
Learned a lotta lessons
from that movie.

178
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,800
This is just one of 'em.

179
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,500
Okay, just summarize.

180
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,700
Okay,Fire-Able offenses
include workplace violence

181
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:50,900
And sexual harassment.

182
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
That's it.
That's it, perfect.

183
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,600
We will get him
to hit on somebody,

184
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,600
And then we'll catch
him in the act.

185
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,200
I love catching people
in the act.

186
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,300
That's why I always
whip open doors.

187
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,100
Me too.

188
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,400
Okay, let's get
this started.

189
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,300
Okay.

190
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,200
What are you doing?

191
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,300
I am the bait.

192
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,100
For what?

193
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,200
Men find me desirable.

194
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,000
No, no, no.

195
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, it's a good day too.

196
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,100
I'm wearing my mustard shirt.

197
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,400
You're the bait
for Toby?

198
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,300
- Mm-Hmm.
- No.

199
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,000
For one thing,
he's not gay.

200
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,600
And if somebody were
to be bait,

201
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,000
It would be
Jim or Ryan,

202
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,200
Or me.

203
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,300
- Men find me desirable.
- Yes.

204
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,700
Sure they do,Dwight.

205
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,900
When it comes down to it,
it's a health issue.

206
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,700
I should've written that.

207
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,600
Mm-Hmm, yeah.

208
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,400
Why aren't you as mad
or interested in this as me?

209
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Oh, totally.

210
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
Sorry, are we talking
about the microwave still?

211
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,700
Are you inching
away from me?

212
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,500
No.

213
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,900
Reach your arms out.

214
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm always this close.

215
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Camptown lady sing this song
doo-Dah doo-Dah

216
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,100
Hello,Pam.

217
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,600
Jim, may I have a moment
with Pam, please?

218
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,000
Yes.

219
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
I just have to take
this call anyway, so--

220
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,700
Oh, ooh,
his mistress!

221
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,400
No,I'm kidding.

222
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,000
Nobody would ever
cheat on you.

223
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
You are the complete package,
Pam.

224
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,800
What do you need,Michael?

225
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,400
Okay, what I would
like you to do

226
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Is take this folded note,

227
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,200
And deliver it
to Toby Flenderson.

228
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,100
I want you to just react
to whatever this note elicits.

229
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,000
Do not read it
beforehand.

230
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,100
Can you do that for me?

231
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,300
- Sure.
- Good.

232
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
No, no, no,
no, don't--

233
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,200
"Please hug and kiss me,
no matter how hard I struggle.

234
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,100
I am too shy
to tell you that I love you."

235
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,300
Damn it,Pam.

236
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
You gave me your word.

237
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,800
Hey,guys,
that's really inappropriate.

238
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,900
What's up?

239
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,900
Um,I got some photos
from,uh,Costa Rica

240
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
If you want to see them.

241
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,500
- Yeah, yeah,I'll see 'em.
- Cool.

242
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,100
Toby, can I see those?

243
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,400
Wow.
What's the matter?

244
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,500
What's the matter?

245
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,600
You-- You scared?

246
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,800
- Those are fightin' words.
- You mad?

247
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,400
You mad at me?

248
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,100
I hope he doesn't haul off
and just hit ya.

249
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,700
Do you wanna do that?
You wanna hit me?

250
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,700
You wanna punch me?

251
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
Hmm?
Huh???

252
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,700
- Punch him,Toby.
- I dare you to.

253
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
- Come on.
- Come on,Bam!

254
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,700
What's the matter?

255
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,600
Hit him.
Hit him, chicken.

256
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,400
Yeah, punch him.

257
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,000
Hey, hey, come on,Ryan.

258
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,900
- Whose side are you on?
- Come on, man.

259
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
No, do it.
Do it.

260
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,100
- I dare you.
- Punch him as hard as you

261
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,500
- I dare you.Not..
- possibly can, in the face.

262
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,100
Not as hard as you can.
Just a good, solid punch.

263
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,200
Come on, come on.

264
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,900
I'm not going to punch you,
Michael.

265
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,300
Are you really not
going to punch him?

266
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,800
No,why would I punch you?

267
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,000
Son of a bitch.

268
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,500
Shoulda hit him, man.

269
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,100
Guy was asking for it.

270
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,600
Once in a lifetime, man.

271
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,100
I thought you were gonna parcel
those out through the day.

272
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,200
Would you stop it?

273
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,300
You haven't done
anything helpful all day.

274
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,600
There's still one thing
we can do to get Toby fired.

275
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,500
What's that?

276
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,100
Frame him
for using drugs.

277
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,100
- Frame him?
- Yeah.

278
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,900
It's illegal,but everything they do
on the shield is illegal.

279
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,200
I've never framed a man before.
Have you?

280
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,800
I've framed animals before.

281
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,500
I framed a raccoon
for opening a Christmas present.

282
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,300
And I framed a bear
for eating out of the garbage.

283
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,200
Just seems awfully mean.

284
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,100
But sometimes, the ends
justify the mean.

285
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,800
Hello.

286
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,000
I've seen you guys around.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm Michael Scott,
Dunder Mifflin.

288
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,300
How you doing?

289
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,700
So I guess you know
why I'm here.

290
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,300
I need to purchase something.

291
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,500
Like a fridge?

292
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,200
No.
Uh--

293
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,400
I wanted--

294
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,400
I wanted to buy
some weed from someone.

295
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,900
- What?
- Grass, weed?

296
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,000
What makes you think
we'd have weed?

297
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
I heard you were drug--

298
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,200
I heard you dealt.

299
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,900
Hey, just
hold on one second.

300
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm not wearing
a wire, so--

301
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,400
Why would you
even say that?

302
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,000
Hey, it's gonna be $500.

303
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,600
- How much
- $500.

304
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,700
It's a good price.
It's a steal.

305
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,200
How many pounds is that?

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,900
It's...
It's two pounds.

307
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,600
I'm losing money
on this, man, just--

308
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Give me the money

309
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
- Okay.All right.Walk away
- Walk away.Walk away.

310
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,400
Hey,Pam?

311
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,200
I just wanted
to let you know,

312
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,100
I'm totally on your side with
a whole microwave situation.

313
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,500
Thank you.

314
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,700
I was just back there
to make some cup of soup,

315
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,000
The thing
is still a huge mess.

316
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,100
I know.
Can you believe it?

317
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,800
Yeah, it's crazy.

318
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,900
But I guess the thing is
at some point,

319
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,400
Notes or no notes,

320
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Someone's gonna have to just
get in there and clean it up.

321
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
I guess that's why
we have a temp, huh?

322
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,200
Oh, no, trust me.
I would just make it worse.

323
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,900
How would wiping it with
a paper towel make it worse?

324
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
I-- I would find a way.

325
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,500
You've seen things
clean before though, right?

326
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,600
I-- Pam,I am hopeless
to that stuff.

327
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,900
I-- I, uh--

328
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,900
- Hi,Michael.
- Hey, hey,hey, hey.

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,100
I forgot--
Forgot--

330
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:33,900
Yes,I repeat:

331
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,400
A drug dealer is on
the premises of Dunder Mifflin.

332
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
His name
is Toby Flenderson,

333
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,000
And he recently turned from a
mysterious vacation in Central America.

334
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,900
I have risked a great deal
to tell you this information.

335
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,400
My name is Andy Bernard.
Andrew Bernard, that's my name.

336
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
See you soon.

337
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,500
Hi.
We received a call.

338
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,700
I don't know
anything about that.

339
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,100
We were tipped off about
a possible Narcotic situation.

340
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,400
- Here?
- Hey,Pam--

341
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,900
Hey,I got this, okay?

342
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,600
Hello, officers.

343
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Dwight Schrute, former
volunteer sheriff's deputy.

344
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,700
Listen,I may have
inside information

345
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,000
That someone is hiding drugs
in this very office.

346
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,900
Just pretend like we're talking
until the cops leave.

347
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,000
Those are real cops.
Real guns.

348
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,400
Wonder what's going on.

349
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,400
Officers,I reveal
to you the perpetrator.

350
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,500
Hey, what is this?

351
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,300
Search his things.

352
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,800
Sir,could you step
away from your desk, please?

353
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,600
- Why?
- Sir,please step away from your desk.

354
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Hey, what's going on?

355
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,400
You don't have
my permission to do this.

356
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,100
They don't need
your permission,Flenderson.

357
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,600
They've got
the company's permission.

358
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Hey, hey, what are you--
Why are you doing this?

359
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,500
Uh, you know what?
I think this--

360
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,600
This is probably
a misunderstanding.

361
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,200
- Don't search my stuff.
- Sir

362
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,600
I have a reasonable right to privacy.

363
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,700
Save your whing
for the jury there,Flenderson.

364
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,600
- Yeah,let's just cancel this,okay?
- Michael

365
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,300
Sir, did you recently
return from a trip

366
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,400
- To Central America?
- Oh, my god. There was--

367
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,500
- I went to Costa Rica for a few months.
- Oh,no.That was legitimate.

368
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,400
- That was totally legitimate.
- Hey,Check this out.

369
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,100
Oh, god!

370
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,600
That is not mine.
I even...

371
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Turn around please, would you?

372
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,300
- No, no, no, no,God.
- What is going on here?

373
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,100
No, that's--
I don't know what that is...And

374
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,700
- Do you have any weapons?
- I bet he has nothing to do with that.
- Of course not!

375
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,500
Ah.
That's mine.

376
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,600
- No,Michael,No!
- Yes, it's mine.

377
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,900
Some basil.

378
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,000
And salad dressing,
I think.

379
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,000
Salad dressing?

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Yeah,it's,uh,
caprese salad.

381
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
There's a little bit
of, uh, mozzarella right there.

382
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,900
Are you kidding me?

383
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,200
That's my salad.

384
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,700
So wait a minute.
There's no drugs?

385
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,300
- No.
- Oh, damn it.Come on!

386
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,000
We got a fake tip.

387
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait, officers, are you sure you
don't want to interrogate him?

388
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,000
- No.
- You have laws that protect you

389
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,600
In any kind of interrogation.

390
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,100
Why don't you use them?

391
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,100
You must feel pretty good
about yourself right now.

392
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,100
I didn't put caprese salad
in my drawer,Michael.

393
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,200
Did you?

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,200
Since when is it illegal
to put caprese salad anywhere?

395
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,200
You know,but the police
could have been out there,

396
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,100
You know,catching real criminals,
Instead of here,

397
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,400
- searching my stuff.
- Are you kidding me?

398
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,200
Are you kidding me?

399
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,600
That you're worried about?

400
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,400
You're worried
about the cops' time.

401
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,900
You think I framed you, and
you're worried about the taxpayer?

402
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,900
Ah, god!

403
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,000
Welcome back,
jerky jerk-Face.

404
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,900
You said you were leaving,

405
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
And you made liars
out of all of us.

406
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,100
- I did leave.
-So.. Yes, you did.

407
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,400
And then you came back.

408
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,900
Which makes you
the biggest liar of history.

409
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,300
I don't see
it that way.

410
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
You wanna hear a lie?

411
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,800
- What?
- I think you're great.

412
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,100
You're my best friend.

413
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,900
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

414
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,100
It's not fair to you.

415
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,300
And it's really
not fair to me.

416
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,500
Wait,What are you saying?

417
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,000
I broke up with Darryl
so I could be with you.

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,900
That was your choice.
Don't put that on me.

419
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm just going
on a little trip.

420
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,300
Oh, can I come?

421
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,400
It's not that kind of trip.

422
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,900
I'm going to Thailand with some
friends from high school.

423
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,100
Well, a high school.

424
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,200
And if I don't do it now,
I'll never get to go.

425
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,300
And I'll always
resent you for it.

426
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,900
You don't want me
to resent you, do you?

427
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,800
So you're dumping me?

428
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,200
Let's be adults about this.

429
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,200
Let's have sex one more time,

430
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,000
And if you have any extra cash,
that would be amazing.

431
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Okay.

432
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,500
Hey, do you mind if we make
a stop on the way home

433
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
- Sure.
- Cool.

434
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,300
What are we doing
at your parents' house?

435
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,600
I have a surprise
for you.

436
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,900
All right.
Ready?

437
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,200
Close your eyes.

438
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
And now...

439
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,100
Open your eyes.
Ta-Da!

440
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't get it.

441
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,400
I bought it.

442
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,400
It's ours.

443
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,100
Let's go inside.
I'll show you inside.

444
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,100
So if you can believe it,
I did it without a realtor.

445
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
So saving
on closing costs is good.

446
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,400
And, uh, we can put all of
the money to de-Shag the carpet.

447
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,600
Which I think will help

448
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,700
The color situation.

449
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,900
Yeah,I am really sorry
about this.

450
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,700
I tried to move it,

451
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,400
But he is really
nailed in there.

452
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,800
Worried about art theft,
I guess.

453
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,000
A lot of art thieves
in this neighborhood.

454
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,500
This is the master bedroom.

455
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,800
But I'm actually
not allowed in here, so.

456
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,500
So I'm still in the process
of converting the garage.

457
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,300
It's got great light
in here.

458
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,200
And I was thinking
it could be perfect

459
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,800
For an art studio.

460
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Look,I know.

461
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,600
I bought this
without asking you.

462
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:12,600
And it doesn't look great.
I know that.

463
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,600
And if you really hate it,
I totally understand.

464
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,900
- It's just--
- I love it.

465
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,900
You do?

466
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,700
Yeah,I love it.

467
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,500
Really?

468
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,200
???You bought me a house.

469
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,500
Oh, my God.

470
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,200
You bought me a house!

471
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,700
Yeah,I did.

472
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,400
Um,do we have to sleep
in your parents' bedroom?

473
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,900
No.

474
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,300
No,We'll just board that up.

475
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,100
It'll be that weird spare room
that people ask us about.

476
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,000
And the clown?

477
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,800
Yeah,I can't--
Really can't move him.

478
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,500
What is my perfect crime?

479
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,800
I break into Tiffany's
at midnight.

480
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,100
Do I go for the vault?

481
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
No,I go for the chandelier.

482
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
It's priceless.

483
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
As I'm taking it down,
a woman catches me.

484
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,800
She tells me to stop.
It's her father's business.

485
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
She's tiffany.
I say no.

486
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,100
We make love all night.

487
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,500
In the morning,
the cops come,

488
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,200
And I escape
in one of their uniforms.

489
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,800
I tell her
to meet me in Mexico,

490
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,200
But I go to Canada.

491
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,100
I don't trust her.

492
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,900
Besides, I like the cold.

493
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,100
30 years later,
I get a post card.

494
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,700
I have a son,
and he's the chief of police.

495
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,500
This is where the story
gets interesting.

496
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,900
I tell Tiffany to meet me
in Paris by the Trocadero.

497
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,100
She's been waiting for me
all these years.

498
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,700
She's never taken another lover.

499
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't care.
I don't show up.

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I go to Berlin.

501
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,300
That's where
I stashed the Chandelier.
