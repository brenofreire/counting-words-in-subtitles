1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,700
I had no idea when i got into
that car to go to new york

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,100
That i was going to be quitting.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,500
I got on the ramp,

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,500
And i was like, "two
hours, two hours to go."

5
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,700
Feelin' good.
Crank some tunes.

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,300
Should have peed before i left."

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,900
- Michael, get to the good part.
- Okay, so.

8
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,700
Get up to building.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,400
Revolving door broken.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,600
So i have to take
the normal door.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,700
Oh, my god.

12
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,700
At least he's in the building.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,900
No. No.

14
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,100
I was so nervous,
it was the wrong building.

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,000
I had walked into
the wrong building.

16
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,100
He finally has a story
we really want to hear.

17
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,000
And he knows it.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,300
Okay, focus, focus.

19
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,300
You're in the right building.

20
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,400
You're with the right people.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,900
- What happened?
- I looked at wallace and i said,

22
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
"I quit."

23
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And as i turned to leave,
i looked back and i said,

24
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,000
"You have no idea
how high i can fly."

25
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,200
You didn't tell him how
sick of him you were?

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,700
Why would i do that?

27
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,500
Well, wouldn't it feel good to
tell him that he's incompetent.

28
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,000
That he's wasted 15
years of your life.

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,700
Maybe spit in his face.

30
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,900
You guys have thought about
this a lot more than i have.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,900
I just winged it.

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,900
I love a good quitting story.

33
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,900
It makes me feel like i have
control over my own life.

34
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,100
Gives me hope.

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,600
Maybe i'll have one
of my own someday.

36
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,900
But i dream.

The office s5 ep19

40
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,000
About a week ago, michael
gave his two weeks' notice.

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,400
And surprisingly,

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,800
There is a very big difference
between michael trying

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
And michael not trying.

44
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
Michael, is that scotch?

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
Scotch and splenda.

46
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,300
Tastes like splenda,
gets you drunk like scotch.

47
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,500
Clinky clinky clink.
Come on.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
Come on, come on.

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
What am i gonna do?

50
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,900
I'll tell you
what i'm gonna do.

51
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm gonna do a little bit
of this, a little bit of that.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
I'm gonna stay up all day.

53
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,800
I'm gonna sleep up all night.

54
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm gonna give it a--

55
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,600
And i'm gonna stop
worrying about calories.

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,500
Maybe you should
go into your office,

57
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
Close the door, and make
some calls about jobs.

58
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,800
- I have a job.
- For four more days.

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,600
Do you have any
leads on a job?

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,800
Pam, what you don't understand.

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,000
At my level, you don't just
look in the want ads for a job.

62
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,100
You are headhunted.

63
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,300
Have you called any headhunters?

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Any good headhunter
knows that i am available.

65
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
Any really good headhunter
will storm your village

66
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,100
At sunset with overwhelming force

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,000
And cut off your head
with a ceremonial knife.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,700
Right, 'cause that's
what we're talking about.

69
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,400
I need you to go over
these client lists

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,500
and indicate any
wrong or false data.

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,900
Your "i need you to"
is my command.

72
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,100
Okay.

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,300
- Hey, michael.
- Hey.

74
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
Can i talk to you for a minute?

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,900
You can talk to me for
as long as you want,

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,300
Because i have all
the time in the world.

77
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,300
Oh, god.

78
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,200
Ugh. Phyllis.

79
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,600
I just wanted to, uh,
tell you that--

80
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,000
- Oh! Ah, what's that?
- Oh, hey!

81
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,700
What is this about?

82
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,600
Um, you know,
'cause you're go--

83
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,500
You're leaving and everything.
It's a farewell.

84
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
Right.

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,500
So i hope i get to work
with you some day again.

86
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,800
Me, too. Me, too.

87
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,300
- Is this wine?
- Ah! Busted, yes.

88
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,300
- I already have wine.
- Oh.

89
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
- Hello.
- Hi.

90
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,000
Isaac silby here
for the interview.

91
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,200
Uh, yes. Please have a seat.
It'll be a few minutes.

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,300
Thank you.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,100
You interviewing, too?

94
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:12,100
Mmm. Hmm?

95
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,500
Interviewing?

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,700
- For?
- Regional manager.

97
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,700
Yes, i am.

98
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,500
For regional manager, i've
decided to go with an outside hire.

99
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,700
For obvious reasons.

100
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,900
Where you from?

101
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,700
- Philly.
- That's a drive.

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,500
Yeah, well, this is one of the
few places that's hiring. It's--

103
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,600
It's brutal out there.

104
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,300
- Pam.
- Mm-Hmm?

105
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,900
When will the new
copier be ready?

106
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,200
I'm working on it, kev.

107
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
You said it would
be ready by today.

108
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,300
And it is today.

109
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,700
It'll be ready soon.

110
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,600
Soon could mean anything.

111
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,700
Soon could be three weeks.

112
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,000
Is that what "soon"
means to you?

113
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,600
Sometimes.

114
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,500
Then come back soon.

115
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
During the course of business,

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
A copier goes through something
called "normal wear and tear."

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I think it's 75 cents.

118
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,300
That's a lot.

119
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,400
Bandit, no.

120
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,200
No, no, no.

121
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,800
Yesterday they
delivered the new one.

122
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,600
But they didn't set it up.

123
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,800
So my day just got a
little more interesting.

124
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
It's monster.Com.
Singular.

125
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,900
Thank you.

126
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,200
You work in paper long enough,
you get to know the players.

127
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,600
Hi, you've reached prince paper.

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,600
We are sad to inform you That after
40 years of serving the community,

129
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,500
We are no longer in business.

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,700
Thank you for your support
And may god bless you.

131
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,000
Bye!

132
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,100
What am i gonna do?

133
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,700
yeah.

134
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,200
You want me to come
into your office?

135
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,600
Oh, okay.

136
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,800
Okay.

137
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,800
All right.

138
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
Uh, close your eyes.

139
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,800
- I'd prefer not to.
- Just close your eyes.

140
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm going to start my
own paper company.

141
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,500
You're starting your
own paper company.

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,300
- Yeah!
- Why?

143
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,400
Can you believe--

144
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,200
'Cause i know paper.

145
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,100
I know everything there
is to know about paper.

146
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you know that the
industry is in decline?

147
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,800
yeah. Oh, god, i practically
invented decline.

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,500
- Right.
- Right?

149
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,400
I know paper.
I know how to manage.

150
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,700
I have a name.
Close your eyes.

151
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,400
No, i did that before.
It added nothing.

152
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
- Just close 'em.
- Okay.

153
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,800
All right.
"Michael scott paper company."

154
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,600
You want in?

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,300
Do you want to
be a part of this?

156
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,500
I am not gonna do this.

157
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,200
- Oh. Obvious--
- And you are not going to, either.

158
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,900
Oh, agreed.

159
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
- Mmm, except--
- Here's the thing.

160
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,500
What i wish for you is that
you land a job at a company

161
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,900
That"a," exists,
and "b," has a salary

162
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,100
Because they're set up
to do that kind of thing.

163
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,800
What's up, chuck?

164
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
- Jim.
- Hey.

165
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,800
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just talking.

166
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Okay. Michael handed in
his two-Week notice.

167
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,200
- Did you also hand in your two-Week--
- I didn't.

168
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,500
No? Okay.

169
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,700
- After you.
- No, i'm staying.
- Okay.

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,100
You want me to translate the
german instructions for you?

171
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,400
No, i'm sure they're pretty much
the same as the english instructions.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,200
Typical american arrogance

173
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,200
that got us involved In a war
we never should have been in.

174
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,000
- That's a really--
- World war ii.

175
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:10,900
Well, fine.

176
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,700
Do the german instructions say
what this is supposed to do?

177
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
???

178
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Let me see here.

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,100
It is either an incense dispenser

180
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,300
Or a

181
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,900
Ceremonial

182
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Sarcophagus.

183
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,700
My german is pre-Industrial
and mostly religious.

184
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Listen, 

185
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,200
this order form--

186
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,900
Instead of saying
"dunder mifflin" at the top,

187
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,100
Is there any way i could
get it to say something else?

188
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,000
Like "michael scott
paper company"?

189
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,300
You-- Oh.

190
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,500
Somebody's been talking
in bed. Pillow talk.

191
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Yeah.

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Listen, michael.

193
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Have you really
thought this through?

194
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,500
'Cause it's a pretty big risk.

195
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,400
This is a dream

196
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,200
that i have had since lunch,
And i am not giving up on it now.

197
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,300
yeah.

198
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,100
You could give it
up though, right?

199
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,900
And almost no one would know.

200
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,200
Before you got here,

201
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm the one who landed
all of these clients.

202
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Half of 'em, at least.
I can do it again.

203
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,200
I know the market.

204
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,500
I know the price points.

205
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm on it.
Don't worry.

206
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,500
So how do i do that?

207
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,600
Well, um, you can scan it.

208
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,500
And then you can
upload the image,

209
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,700
- And then you can copy a new image--
- Could i take a piece of paper

210
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,300
And just tape it with
transparent tape?

211
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,100
Yeah. Good.

212
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,500
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Mm-Hmm.

213
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,200
So that is why i have to
leave at 5:00 on tuesdays.

214
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,500
It's to pick up my
little sisters from school.

215
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,800
We're really tight.

216
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,200
We're like the kardashians.

217
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,200
You know, you can run
this stuff by toby.

218
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
- Yeah, i don't like talking--
- Come in.

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,100
I'm sorry.

220
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,700
I didn't realize you
were with anyone.

221
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,700
But i just wanted to
bring you the brochure

222
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,200
On that accounting seminar
that i was telling you about.

223
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,000
- Yep.
- Earlier.

224
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,100
I can wait we're in the
middle of something, angela,

225
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,100
- So why don't you just--
- Okay, um, actually, you kndow,

226
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,200
It was so much fun last year.

227
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,900
There was a sundae bar.

228
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,300
I mean, i didn't have any--

229
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:07,500
You know, to stay trim.

230
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,300
Did michael just let
anybody in his office?

231
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,200
- Yes.
- Yeah.

232
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,700
He was like, "come in."

233
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,500
I am aware of the effect
i have on women.

234
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,300
So you should be
heading back to your desk.

235
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay. Bye, charles.

236
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,700
Well, you'll let me know. 
Good-Bye.

237
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,600
She's such a special person.

238
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,400
She's turning 50 this year.

239
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,000
Sorry. I'm starting my
own paper company.

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,700
-  No way!
- Yeah.

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,300
In this climate?

242
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,900
In all climates.

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,600
It's going to be worldwide.

244
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
And i'm looking for some
talented salesmen to join me.

245
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,200
That's where you come in.

246
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,300
Well, it's a very
intriguing concept, isn't it?

247
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,700
Michael is starting his
own paper company.

248
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,200
What do you think about that?

249
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Your own paper company.

250
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,200
Can you believe it?

251
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,600
Well, we'll see.
We'll see.

252
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,300
well.

253
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,700
It's just a-- It's a nugget
of an idea right now,

254
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
- so.
- what?

255
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,000
Potential. Lots of potential. Yes.

256
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,800
What a--Courageous--

257
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,500
- Venture.
- It's--

258
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,800
It's very courageous.
Very exciting.

259
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,600
Umm...Location is hard for me,

260
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,400
with the farm And
the responsibilities so--

261
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,500
With the farm.

262
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,500
You getting to wherever
i'm gonna put my thing.

263
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,000
- Okay, so yeah.
- So think about it.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
- Let's put a pin in it for now.
- You know,

265
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
i would love to
put a pin in that.

266
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Everyone, can I
have your attention?

267
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,500
This is the moment you've
all been waiting for.

268
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,700
Right?

269
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Little miss thing wants attention.

270
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,800
Meredith--

271
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,300
G-44.

272
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
It's not ready, kevin.

273
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,300
I am at a crucial point

274
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,100
Where i have sunk four
hours into that copier.

275
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,700
And i am not gonna let it beat
me like that wireless router did.

276
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,000
- You put a note in my food?
- I made it sterile.

277
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,700
Just to say "sterile"
doesn't make it so.

278
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,400
I am offering you

279
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,000
The opportunity of a lifetime,
oscar, to come work for me.

280
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,600
Do you have a business plan?

281
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,000
A funding request?

282
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,600
- Market research? Financials?
- No.

283
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,300
- You need those things.
- No. No!

284
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,000
Most new businesses,

285
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,100
They don't make a profit
till at least two years.

286
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,500
And then your margins
will be razor-Thin.

287
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,900
Best-Case scenario,

288
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,100
You don't cut yourself a salary
for at least five years.

289
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,000
Can you go five years
without a salary, michael?

290
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
- Okay.
- Five years?

291
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
Hey. You already have the job.

292
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,900
You don't have to convince me.

293
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,500
It's just not prudent, michael.

294
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Stanley.

295
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,200
Can't you see i'm urinating?

296
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,000
Listen, listen.

297
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,800
Stanley, you don't
need to answer me now.

298
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,400
No.

299
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,900
Just-- I want you
to think about it.

300
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,200
- I am starting my own company.
- No.

301
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,100
Okay, you're not
letting me finish,

302
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,900
And you just lost
out on $1 million.

303
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,300
No, i didn't.

304
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,300
You know what?

305
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,600
I had a great time at prom.

306
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,900
And no one said
"yes" to that, either.

307
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,700
How's it working?

308
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:26,000
Um, let's see.

309
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
It's fine.

310
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,100
I did it.

311
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,200
I learned everything
about this machine.

312
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,100
I know all the buttons,
even the inside ones.

313
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,300
I know all the error messages.

314
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
I could do a bound book

315
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,800
In plastic with offset colors.

316
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,000
Which feels...

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,800
Hey, hank. You ready?

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,400
- Yeah.
- Okay.

319
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,300
- Michael.
- Hmm?

320
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,000
I can't pretend
i haven't seen that.

321
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,200
So i'm gonna ask you
to stand up, walk out,

322
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,700
And you can't take anything.

323
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,400
Okay. I have immunity.
It's my two weeks--

324
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,200
Not if you're starting a competing
paper company, michael.

325
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,100
Hank. 

326
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
Okay, michael.

327
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,400
Hank?

328
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,900
You really think hank is
going to be loyal to you?

329
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,000
Hank, please escort charles
from the building.

330
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,500
Come on, man,
let's-- Let's go.

331
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,800
I always thought
michael got a bad rap.

332
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,100
He's a good guy,

333
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,800
And he's super funny.

334
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,300
Yeah, maybe i should
tell him before he goes.

335
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,700
He's all the way over there.

336
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Well, here we are.

337
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:51,000
- I would just like to
- No, no, no, no.

338
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,900
You're done, michael.

339
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,400
All right, then, everybody.
I'm out of here.

340
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,100
What is he doing?

341
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,700
It looks like he's
saying something.

342
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,200
I think he's singing.

343
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,600
I can't believe this
is really happening.

344
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,700
And i feel free.

345
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,900
And just like that,

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,900
As mysteriously as he arrived,

347
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,900
He was gone.

348
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,400
The whole office feels darker.

349
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,600
You know?

350
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
It's just a sad, dark day.

351
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,500
- Andy, he's gone.
- I know.

352
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,400
You don't have to
kiss his ass anymore.

353
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,300
Michael's like a
movie on a plane.

354
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,100
You know, it's not great,
but it's something to watch.

355
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,900
And then when it's
over, you're like,

356
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,700
"How much time is left
on this flight?

357
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now what?"

358
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,600
- Michael.
- Shh, shh, shh.

359
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,700
Don't look down.

360
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,300
Look straight up.

361
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,400
- Are those--
- All right, come on. Ow!

362
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,600
- Please.
- These are for employees only.

363
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,900
Angela, kevin,
help me out.

364
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,100
I just need a few things.
Then i'll be gone.

365
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,600
Michael, why is it that you asked

366
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,200
everyone Except me,
angela, creed, and meredith?

367
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,600
I was going to.

368
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,400
I wanted to, but i had
to start somewhere.

369
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,200
And you didn't want
to start with us?

370
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,000
No, of course not.
But now i want everybody.

371
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,400
Jim!

372
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,200
Did you have time to
think about my offer?

373
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,600
I did have a chance
to think about it,

374
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,000
But then i thought
about something else.

375
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,200
So which way are you leaning?

376
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,200
Well, it is tempting, but i am
100% leaning towards passing.

377
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,000
Thanks, jim.

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,300
Hey, did anyone see the client list

379
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,100
That michael was supposed
to be working on?

380
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,900
No.

381
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,000
Okay. Let me know if you find it.

382
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,800
Okay.

383
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,700
Listen.

384
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,200
Okay. Okay.

385
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,800
We don't have much time.

386
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,300
Just act normal.

387
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
Don't look at me,
people. Stop.

388
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,600
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

389
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
He's gonna see me.
Not all the way up.

390
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,300
Keep 'em at a normal height, okay?

391
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,400
Hey, this is not michael
scott talking right now.

392
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,500
This is your future.

393
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,700
Hello.
I am your future.

394
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,500
You are older and
you are very happy now

395
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,300
Because you went with
michael scott, right?

396
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,800
So everybody,

397
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
And let's just crawl

All right?

399
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:58,900
Come on.

400
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,400
Are you-- Are you
doing your best here?

401
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you being the
best that you can be?

402
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,100
All right.

403
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,400
Everybody who's
gonna go with me,

404
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,000
I want you to stomp your foot.

405
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,800
Okay.

406
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,500
All right.
Come on.

407
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,400
Come on.

408
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,700
You're coming with me.

412
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,800
- Michael, get up.
- Oh, god. Okay.

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,200
All right, all right.
Time to go.

Time to go.
Jim, let's go.

415
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,300
- Come on. Come on!
- Michael, what are you doing?

416
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,100
I think maybe hank should be here.

417
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,700
Hank? No, i don't
need hank, michael.

418
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,000
You're gonna mess with me?

419
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Is that what you're gonna do?
I'll tell you something, charles.

420
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,400
I don't even care,

421
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,200
because i've got nothing to lose.

422
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,000
- Okay.
- Oh, my god. Oh, god!

423
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,600
No! No.
All right.

424
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,200
It's not worth it.

425
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,400
- Oh, no.
- What?

426
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
I'm going with him.

427
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 What?

428
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,300
- Pam.
- I'm going.

429
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:14,200
Pam, you can't be serious.

430
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,200
Michael, wait!

431
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm coming with you.

432
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,200
You are?

433
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,300
Yeah.

434
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Okay. It's gonna be great.

435
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,800
Great. Uh, except i--

436
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,100
I don't want to be
a receptionist anymore.

437
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,300
Right.

438
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,100
Executive assistant.

439
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,800
Salesman.

440
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,700
All right.

441
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,800
- Okay. Deal.
- Deal.

442
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Okay. 

443
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
- Well, jim?
- Still no.

444
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,500
- Okay.
- Yeah.

445
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,600
Well, let's go.

446
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Oh, all my stuff is still upstairs.

447
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,500
Are people watching?

448
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Probably.

449
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,700
Michael, it's not how
you leave an office.

450
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,100
- It's how you--
- Jim, jim. Jim.

451
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,000
We're having a
company meeting here.

452
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,400
I will bring all your stuff home.

453
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
- Okay.
- All right.

454
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,400
- Well, see ya later.
- Bye.

455
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
See ya later.

456
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,100
So we had a personnel change today.

457
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
Shouldn't affect
our day-To-Day,

458
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,900
But until we get
a new receptionist,

459
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,200
I want kevin on the phones.

460
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,700
Phones.

461
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,300
Also, there's been
too much wasting time.

462
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,600
- So stanley.
- Yes?

463
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,300
Yeah, i want you
on top of that, okay?

464
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,300
I want you to be my
productivity czar.

465
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
Okay? Good.

466
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,900
Um, okay, that's it on my list

467
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
So, uh, you know,
no excuses, guys.

468
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Let's get going, okay?
