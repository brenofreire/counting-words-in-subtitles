1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,010
good morning. can i help you?

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,440
yes,i'm from techstar about
a new phone system for you.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,580
i was wondering if i could
talk to michael scott.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,090
i'm sorry.

5
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,660
he's not in right now.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,400

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,950
he's never around when i come by.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,340
shoot.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:25,650
they have new phone systems now that can ring directly to a
salesman,or someone presses star and they go to accounting.

10
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,320
basically,95% of my job.

11
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,980
but i'd like to see a machine
that puts out candy for everyone.

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,950
vending machine.

13
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,750
how about i make an
appointment to come back?

14
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,800
that way i know he'll be her

15
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,160
that is a great idea.

16
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,680

17
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:48,640

00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,710

need a new system,though.

24
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,820

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,940

it's been four mon since i wawith holly.

44
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,780
and she was way hotter than stacy.

45
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,980
- so if you think you're
hurting- i can't even imagine.

46
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:32,250
this is our first and only
valentine's day as fiances.

47
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,680
you're only engednce.

48
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,770
well,present company
excluded,but-

49
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,230
really,jim.

50
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,270
- on cupid's birthday.
- yeah.

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,350
she's

52
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:46,500
so i received my first
valentine from a secret admirer.

53
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,510
"roses are red,violets are blue,"

54
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,430
it's time for your dental
cleaning and maybe a check-up,too.

55
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,050
look at those.

56
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,500
how nice for you.

57
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,140
uphere front andene
teofr. fi ce beautiful.

58
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,980
i think they would
look better right here.

59
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,190
they're very pretty,and i
wouldn't want them to fall.

60
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,490
just about everybody in this
office is single right now,

61
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,620
including me,and everyone is experiencing
an incredible amnt of emotional pain.

62
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:29,070
especially me,because of my
great capacity for emotion.

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,830
and it is my first
valentine's day since holly,

64
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,770
so i think that i am
well-qualified to understand

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:43,790
that these people need to be protected
from having love shoved into their faces.

66
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,840
pam,really?they're back?

67
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,040
i can't see them when
they're on the floor.

68
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,780
they're for her to look at,michael.

69
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,530
- could i have a word with you,champ?
- yes,let's have a word.

70
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,020
yes.

71
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,960
um,jim.

72
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:58,000
today's a ry difficult day for
a lot of people in this office.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,310
- oh,i'm sorry.
- yeah.

74
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,110
and the sexy looks between you and
pam- the general sexiness,the flowers-

75
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,550
it's creating a bit of a
hostile work environment.

76
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,000
- i understand,yeah.
- it's so sexy it becomes hostile.

77
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:12,390
oh,i actually thought we
were keeping it pret low-key.

78
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,530
- well,if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest...
- we do.

79
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,520
that none of us can be a part of...

80
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,210
you can't be a part of
our relationship,michael.

81
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:25,470
then we are going to have our
own private valentine's day party.

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,700
- that sounds fun.
- so suck it.

83
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,440
- yeah.
- yes.

84
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,720
hey,everybody.

85
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:34,690
i just invited jim to suck it,and i am cordially
inviting all of you to a special convention-

86
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,750

convention this afternoon.

88
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,200
yeah!deal with it,pam!

89
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,610
so we may not have someone
in our lives that we love,

90
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,850
but we do have each other.

91
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,260
having trouble finding a vein?

92
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,960
yeah,a little.

93
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,860
how about now?

94
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,580
i've trained my major blood vessels
to retract into my body on command.

95
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:08,170
also,i can retract my
penis up into itself.

96
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,080
i am about to give blood.

97
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,210
the gift of everlasting life.

98
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,590
the transfer of my
bodily fluids- n wow!

99
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,280
that's a big needle.

100
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,440
- that- you're gonna
need to lie down over here.

101
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,360

102
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,790

clam up and- oh,well,that's fine.

108
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,820
it's better for me just to be quiet.

109
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,240

110
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:40,010

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,330

128
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,730

00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,760
relationships?

179
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,450
we don't need no stinkin' relationships.

180
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,380
i think we should all go around and tell our
worst relationship story and then get past it.

181
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,650
just blow through it.

182
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,600
yeah?

183
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:39,680
kelly,what about ryan?

184
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,650
he treated you pretty terribly,yeah?

185
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,400
well,his heart was in the right place.

186
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:48,400
yeah,but now his heart is in thailand- along
with the rest of his body,having random sex.

187
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,940
okay. sorry.

188
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,490
let's-
who else?

189
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,600
oscar?

190
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,190
i don't think so.

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,090
come on. i'm sure there's something
you need to get off your chest.

192
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,920
- thank you. - youanna-
just- anything?

193
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,020
you sure?i'm sure whatever
you did wasn't your fault.

194
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,640
okay,well,we'll-
who else?

195
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:09,660
everyone here who's bowled
a 280 please raise your hand.

196
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,160
no way. 280?

197
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,360
that's impressive.

198
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,490
okay. noeveryone here who's
bowled under 70 raise their hand.

199
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,750
yikes.

200
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,420
- come on,bob. raise your
hand. - no,bob,not- no!

201
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,430
- what?
- one time. you just love bringing up that one time.

202
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,350
- don't you?
- i do,i do.

203
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,820
jim uses a six-pound ball.

204
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,850
that is a lie.

205
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,240
yes,he bowled five frames with this pink,sparkly
thing until a little girhad to ask for her ball back.

206
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,940
but that girl must have had
monstrous hands because the holes fit.

207
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,250
no,you just have little dainty fingers.

208
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,220
you could always model ladies' jewelry.

209
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,060
nobody asked,bob.

210
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,180
do you risk telling them how you feel?

211
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,950
do you say something that you
can barely admit to yourself?

212
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,440
- oh,god,what
did you do?- so-

213
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,040
wait,not that i approve
of any of it,but-

214
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,540
i was stupid. i told him.

215
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,540
was he into you in,like,a gay way?

216
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,660
moron.

217
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,780
if he was,there wouldn't be a story.

218
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,810
he told me he wasn't gay.

219
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,020
really sad.

220
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,120
i'm not done yet.

221
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,100
oh,my god.

222
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,740
a week later,a friend of
mine calls me up and he says,"

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,950
i just saw him in a
gay bar in kansas city.

224
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,180
" oh,no.

225
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,980
well,then it's a happy
ending,because he was gay.

226
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,650
you should call him.

227
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,540
my worst breakup was
actually two breakups.

228
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,480
two different men.

229
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:30,250
i was in love with both of them,and when
things went bad,they had a duel over me.

230
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,820
yeah,dwight and andy. we were here.

231
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,880
no,this was years ago
when i was living in ohio.

232
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,900
john mark anjohn david.

233
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,730
angela,you had two sets of
different men actually duel over you?

234
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,530
i guess i have.

235
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,140
all right.

236
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,990
who's next?where's andy?

237
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,930
he's on one of his honeymoons.

238
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,660
what?

239
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,960
he made non-refundable
deposits on his honeymoons,

240
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,330
so he's just knockin'
'em off one at a time.

241
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,630
i think today he's hot air ballooning,and
later he's got a couples' massage.

242
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,590
my worst breakup was with stacy.

243
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,830
it was a sunday morning.

244
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,740
we were reading the par.

245
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,360
and i said,"oh,my god.

246
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,430
i think the eagles could
clench the n. f. c. east.

247
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,580
" and she said that we're done.

248
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,880
you know what,ys?

249
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,820
i don't think we need to do this.

250
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,890
you're right. okay,everyone,back to work.

251
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,110
no,no,no,no. i mean,have
this kind of party.

252
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,390
i look around and i see all these beautiful
people who are alone on valentine's,

253
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,780
and i think that there are other
single people out there,too.

254
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,480
we just ne tfind 'em.

255
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,200
there's a girl out there for all of us.

256
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,540
maybe even in this office park.

257
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:46,160
there has to be a way to get
all these lonely people together.

258
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,300
a net?a giant net?

259
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,630
no,not a giant net.

260
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,300
- a- a- a- what
do you have in mind?

261
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,540
i was thinking maybe like a mixer.

262
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,450
- oh,god. that's a terrible
idea. - old-fashioned meat market.

263
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,610
- no.
- i don't think it is.

264
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,770
lonely people mixing with one another?

265
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,980
breeding?

266
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,370
creating an even lonelier generation?

267
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,970
you're not allowing natural
selection to do its work.

268
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,300
kind of like the guy who
invented the seat belt.

269
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:10,050
these people need love.

270
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,020
and i am going to get it for them.

271
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,640
who cares if we sell a
little bit less paper today?

272
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,540
a great boss cares more about thhaceppiness
of his employees than anything else.

273
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,030
********

274
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:25,620
i am going to be cupid,and i am going to
shoot my sparrow at unsuspecting victims,

275
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,790
and they are going to get
hit,and say,"i'm in love!

276
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,230
i was hit by cupid's sparrow.

277
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,780
" funny little bird,but
he gets the job done..

278
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,460
no movement.

279
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,770
ah,still early.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,510
eh,it's not that early.

281
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,610
so how you holding up?

282
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,070
i'm okay. feel a little lopsided 'cause of
all the blood they took out of my right side.

283
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,370
no,no,i meant about being single today.

284
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,960
exactly.

285
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:53,800
oh,here we go.

286
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,790
- hello.
- hello.

287
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,910
dwight k. schrute.

288
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,840
why don't you introduce
me to your little friend?

289
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,740
- dwight
- babe alert!

290
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:03,190
hello,i'm michael scott. welcome
to our little shindig.

291
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,400
oh,hi,i'm lynn.

292
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,390
- lynn,follow me. come on in.
- off we go.

293
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:08,750
for you,we have one of our top people.

294
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,250
kevin malone.

295
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,960
kevin?come out here. show
your beautiful self.

296
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,560
hello.

297
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,980
so run with the ball.

298
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,030
run with it,kev.

299
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,520
where are you from?

300
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,240
i'm from here.

301
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,510
y-
okay.

302
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,300
well,he only gets better.

303
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,130
- thank you,michael.
- okay.

304
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,170
i can untie any knot.

305
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,550
i'm serious.

306
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,240
name a knot,any knot. go ahead.

307
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,190
uh,i- i
believe you.

308
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,020
you shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

309
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,050
in fact,there are many
knots that i cannot untie.

310
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,140
so where does a woman as charming as yourself
find herself employed on a day such as today?

311
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,440
um,i work at a place that does catalogs
for community colleges and small businesses.

312
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,240
you must use a lot of paper.

313
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,640
oh,god. tons of it.

314
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,270
what's the rule about when
people are in the bathroom?

315
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,940
i think if you ordered hot
food,you're allowed to eat.

316
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,850
damn.

317
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,140
they've been in there
for like ten minutes.

318
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,540
look at that.

319
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,440
bob ordered hot food.

320
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,070
yes.

321
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
and i think they gave
him too many fries.

322
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,480
we should help him out.

323
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,690
all right,the circle
drive-in,they show old movies.

324
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,030
it's really cool.

325
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,330
that does sound cool.

326
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:41,230
i used to go there with my fiancee.

327
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,630
before she left me.

328
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,860
no,i- i mean,before
i left her.

329
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,470
she left me.

330
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,940
stupid!

331
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,810
i think i blew it.

332
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,440
it all happened so fast.

333
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,910
so fast.

334
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:08,750
so erik,you mentioned before that
you are in tool and dye repair.

335
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,650
i am.

336
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,660
meredith recently had
a total hysterectomy.

337
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,810
so that's sort of a repair.

338
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,520
I right. i'll let you guys talk.

339
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,820
it's going very well. people are mixing.

340
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,090
a lot of hope.

341
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,760
'cause that's what you hate to
see- when hope gets crushed.

342
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,510
sorry.

343
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,880
thought i heard somebody coming in.

344
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,530
um,so... it's not too late.

345
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:43,030
and the kind of discoun we're talking
about are not- hold on,hold on.

346
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,370
michael,why do you keep
looking at the front door?

347
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,870
- no reason.
- is somebody after you?

348
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:47,990
why do you always go to that?

349
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,980
has anyone ever been after
anyone in this office?

350
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,310
hey,it just takes one.

351
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,300
nobody's after me.

352
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,260
i just- i met a woman when i was giving
blood and i thought she might come by.

353
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,960
you met a woman when you were
giving blood?that is so romantic.

354
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:00,470
it's not a big deal,really.

355
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,730
i just- you know,met
mebody. we hardly talked.

356
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:08,170
i picked up her glove,so i was
hoping i could give it back to her.

357
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:10,390
oh,my god,that makes
it even more romantic.

358
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,390
this is like a modern-dayenchanted.

359
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,810
it's like a fairy tale.

360
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,130
she could be your soul mate.

361
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,310
oh,not likely.

362
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:20,280
three billion women on the planet,most of them
live in asia,so the numbers just don't add up.

363
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,370
- it's possible.
- she could be.

364
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,780
believe me,it's nothing.

365
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,110
i hardly even talked to her.

366
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,490
we just- we were lying
there next to each other.

367
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,890
i think our blood bags touched.

368
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,380
here they come.

369
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,900
- what?
- no,just kidding.

370
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,740
seriously,though,that's enough.

371
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,590
well,just cover it with the broccoli.

372
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,910
- oh,great,i have to cover it with-
do you think they dined and dashed?

373
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,520
well,they didn't dine.

374
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:48,430
so yeah,maybe they just dashed.

375
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,230
i thought we we having a nice time.

376
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,450
we were.

377
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,980
yeah.

378
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,770
- empty.
- mine,too.

379
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,370
oh,boy.

380
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,520
- okay.
- oh,my go

381
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,530
is this the party?

382
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,250
nah.

383
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,020
okay,then.

384
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,310
so where were we?

385
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,620
ah,bowling.

386
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,300
yep,yep. yep.

387
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,620
you didn't eat much there,jimbo.

388
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:47,120
oh,initially i did.

389
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,680
want some meat?

390
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,030
- oh,sure.
- little piece.

391
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,310
no mushroom,though.

392
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,870
- forgot.
- yeah.

393
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,290
thank you.

394
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,740
i'm sorry we did not have
a chance to talk more.

395
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,900
yeah.

396
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,590
i get very nervous
talking to pretty girls.

397
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,650
seriously.

398
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,500
feel how sweaty my hand is.

399
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,270
that's really sweaty.

400
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,860
are you on email?

401
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,040
oh,yeah.

402
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,860
cool.

403
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:26,440
- okay,bye.
- bye,kevin.

404
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,810
good valentine's.

405
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,020
so basically the greater volume you decide to
buy in,the greater discount we can give you.

406
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,690
- okay.
- okay?

407
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,840
- what's up?- look,i'm-
i'm gonna go.

408
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,660
before you go,i'd st love to
get a firm commitment on this.

409
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:44,870
um... you know,maybe sign?

410
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,380
look,we already have a paper supplier.

411
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,650
okay.

412
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,160
well,thanks for wasting my time tonight.

413
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,580
idiot.

414
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,880
god!

415
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,980
you don't deserve her.

416
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,370
thanks,michael.

417
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,100
hey,if anybody
wants to go-

418
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,190

419
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,640
yeah. yeah. sure,michael.

420
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,820
no,this is great.

421
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,520
we'll hanout. absolutely. yeah.

422
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,330
oh,thanks.

423
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,090
michael,it's time.

424
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:45,170
you know what?you guys-
you guys can head out.

425
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,560
i'm- i'm gonna
soldier on a little bit.

426
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,030
come on.

427
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,840
we'll all go.

428
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,620
yeah. yeah. let's go. yeah. okay.

429
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,030
four months ago,i dated
a woman named holly.

430
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:07,370
and,um,this is actually the first time that i've
even considered getting back into that arena again.

431
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,550
you know what?

432
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,920
sometimes it's not about whether
cinderella gets her slipper back,

433
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,470
but it's about the fact that the prince
even picked up the slipper at all.

434
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,280
there's a lot of princesses out there.

435
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:28,340
you know,they have all different
sizes and shapes of feet.

436
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,300
and hands.

437
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,830
so i think... i think
my odds are pretty good.

438
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,820
pardon me. may i have a
chocolate chip cookie?

439
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,190
i gave blood earlier and
i'm still feeling woozy.

440
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,320
of course.

441
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:45,620
that's weird.

442
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:48,360
you got a cotton ball and tape
and we've been using band-aids.

443
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,560
i,uh- oh,i
feel so woozy.

444
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,170
i just- it's
band-aids.

445
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,050
ah,damn.
