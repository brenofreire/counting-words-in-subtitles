00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,200
It's britney, bitch.

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,200
And i am back in the form
of a new company--

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,700
The michael scott paper company.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
Okay.

5
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,400
Not gonna make this one.

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,900
Love thhair.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,100
- Good morning, michael.
- Hello.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,300
They took away my parking space,
But they can't take away my pride.

9
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,500
I would like to invite you all
to come along with me

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,000
On a journey.

11
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,400
Welcome...

12
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,900
to theichael scott
paper company.

13
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:28,700

14
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:44,700
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:summerwind
Sync:╧Бок mzinfo</font>

15
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:52,200
The office 521

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,200
You know, i thought we could
take the customer on a...

17
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,200
then...

18
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,900
then we could...

1
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,500
You realize you're not
actually talking to me, right?

2
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,600
- Then...
- Hey, kelly?

3
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,200
Yes, charles. You wanted me.

4
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,600
Oh, no, i meant-- I meant that kelly.

5
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,300
The new receptionist is also named kelly.

6
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,100
So kelly kapoor has decided
to hover around my desk

7
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,500
So that she can run into charles' office
Every time he calls for kelly.

8
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,300
She thinks that if she says
"you wanted me," enough,

9
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,700
He will, in fact, want her.

10
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,900
It's not the worst plan she's ever had.

11
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,200
Oh, and, kelly...

12
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,200
Yes, charles...
yes, you wanted me.

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,700
Okay, i'm gonna call you kapoor, okay.

14
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,300
And you hannon.

15
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,700
If we're changing names, can i be erin?

16
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,600
It's my middle name.

17
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,000
Erin? Okay. That's very pretty.

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,800
Thanks.

19
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,800
Well, you know what my middle name is?
Rajani ghanda-- And i hate it!

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
<i>I hate it!</i>

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,200
I thought rajani ghanda
was a boy's name.

22
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,200
We are in the heart of it.

23
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,800
And the surge of water carries
our business Out to the sea.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,000
What should we do now?

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,700
We wait and hope that people show up
To the pancake luncheon.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,600
??I think i have done absolutely everything
you can do To prepare for the day.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,100
I've updated our contacts.

28
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,500
I have gotten quotes from suppliers.

29
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,600
I have sent out an e-Vite for our big,
Grand-Opening pancake luncheon.

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,000
Six yeses, one maybe, only 11 nos.

31
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,400
and 788 not yet replieds.

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,500
But of that group, 782 have viewed it.

33
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,900
I'm going to need...

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,700
800 of these On nice, bright paper.

35
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,500
??Coupon for unparalleled
customer service.

36
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,400
I make that one copy And i become
the girl who makes copies.

37
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,500
And by the end of the day
i'm receptionist again.

38
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,300
And the worst part is,
i like making copies.

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,000
The paper comes out all warm and stuff.

40
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,000
And it's cold in there,
'cause it's technically a closet.

41
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,300
What do you think?

42
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:27,700
Let me check.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Oh, no! Clearly a hunter...

44
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
Who knows how to throw
an outfit together.

45
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,600
Thank you.

46
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,300
Yes, i am taking andy hunting after work.

47
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,700
Not long ago we were
sexual competitors.

48
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,700
I used to hate him,
hate him, hate him, hate him.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,200
I studied him to figure out why i h.??

50
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,000
But that blossomed into a very real
friendship, As these things often do.

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,400
You should come into town
this weekend, man.

52
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,300
Yeah, we'll hang out scranton style.

53
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,800
Hey, you said you were gonna
be out of town this weekend.

54
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,800
Please don't listen to my phone calls.

55
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,100
Yeah, she's like, um...

56
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,000
She'd probably be a six in new york,
But she's, like, a seven here in scranton.

57
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,000
Then the boss is my old boss
from dunder mifflin.

58
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,600
It's a small space.

59
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,800
Hey, jim, can i get a--

60
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,900
hi.

61
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,100
Hi.

62
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,600
I need a rundown of your clients.
Can you give that to me?

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,600
- Sure.
- Yeah?

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

65
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,900
What the hell is a rundown?

66
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,700
When did you need that rundown by?

67
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,500
- As soon as possible.
- Okay.

68
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,000
- Just get it right.
- Yeah. Gotcha.

69
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,000
Of course.

70
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I'm gonna dive into the rundown.

71
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,600
I'll be exhausted,
'cause it's like a triathlon.

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,000
Did you want to close this?

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,100
Close--Keep it...

74
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,800
You know, there's a ghost in this office.

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,500
Really?

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:57,600
A woman was murdered
on this very floor in 1816.

77
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,000
Haddie mcgonagle.

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
she was a prostitute.

79
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,600
Why was she in this building?

80
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,100
No, this whole place used to be a brothel.

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,700
There was a tavern on the ground floor.

82
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,000
- That's crazy.
- Yeah, isn't it?

83
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,200
She was bludgeoned to death
By the business end of a riding crop.

84
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
- Oh, my god.
- It was gruesome.

85
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,000
They say she walks these hallways.

86
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,400
If you ever feel a tapping
on your shoulder,

87
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,800
That could be haddie, begging for her life.

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,900
And it could mean that you're next.

89
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,700
Just kidding.

90
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,100
You finding everything okay?

91
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,300
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

92
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
Got some ice.

93
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Oh, this is awkward.

94
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
So i'll see you guys around.

95
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,900
??Buddy.

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,500
Hey, ryan, could you get to
that copy from before?

97
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,900
??Ter at that stuf

98
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,300
that is so insulting.

99
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,500
How is it insulting to say that
you're good at something?

100
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,400
Because the thing that
you're saying i'm good at

101
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
Is pushing a big green button
a bunch of times.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,700
I'm not judging it. It's like...

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,900
I could run gm, but i couldn't fix a car.

104
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,000
It's not saying that
one is better than the other.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Seriously?

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,200
'Cause it sounds like one of those
Is better than the other.

107
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,900
- what the hell?!
- Listen, listen, listen, listen, listen!

108
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,800
I need somebody to make a copy of this!

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,100
Because i don't make copies.
I'm the boss. Got it?

110
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,100
- I make originals.
- Yeah, i make originals too.

111
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,400
- Shut up.
- stop it! Stop it! Bickering...

112
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
stop it!

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,400
- Really.
- Yeah.

114
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
not much. What's up with you?

115
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
No, that's okay. I'm in the bathroom.

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,100
<i>Hey, you been watching
damages this year?</i>

117
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,700
It's so good.

118
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,700
No, you gotta tune in.
It's as good as anything on hbo.

119
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Hey, does blue go with tan?

120
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,500
Somebody just make the copy.

121
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,000
I have, like, a blue shirt.
I don't wear a lot of colors...

122
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,100
??

123
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,000
Just make that copy, okay?

124
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Seriously?

125
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,900
This is what's so important,
Putting naked pictures on the desktop.

126
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,800
That's me and my friend
jasmine, from thailand.

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,900
I don't want to look at
your friend jasmine's boobs all day.

128
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
You could be hot too
if you made any effort at all.

129
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Like how? Dying my hair blonde?

130
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,400
This is from the sun.

131
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,400
Oh, yeah, i bet.

132
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,500
They're getting on my nerves, mom.

133
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Both of them.

134
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,700
R thinks he's too good to be here,
And p is not as much fun without jim.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
??Mic c hear you.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,200

Mom, i'm gonna have to call you back.

138
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,200

140
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,000
No, don't take that. Give that back.

- Give it back for what?

142
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,000

- It's my turn. Come on! Ryan!
- ??

146
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,500
They always say that it is a mistake
To hire your friends.

147
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,900
And they are right.

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,500
So i hired my best friends.

149
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,200

I noticed that your pupils dilated

156

And your skin??

157
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,500

bit of blood rushed In.??

??Well, a little bit of blo
rushed into ne as we.

159
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,300
So where does that leave us?

160
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,000
The last thing i wanna do
is step on your funk, man.

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,100
And i yours.

162
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
So i will cede her to you.

163
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,000
- No, that's ridiculous.
- No, no, no.

164
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,000
Look, you've been here longer.

165
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,200
And besides, i'm a better wing man
Than i am a boyfriend, so...

166
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,400
I just want you and i
to hang out, you know. Just...

167
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,700
??N up.

168
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,800
It has come to my attention

169
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,200
that some people in this office

170
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,700
Are not getting along with
other people in this office.

171
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,400
And i think i have come up
with the reason why.

172
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,700
This office space is too small.

173
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,000
- Definitely.
- Okay.

174
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,100
There are four corners in this room.

175
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,000
Each corner is to be a personal space
For each one of you.

176
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,200
Whichever corner you want.
And make it your own.

177
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,400
- We could work from home.
- Or you could fire one of us.

178
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,100
- Whoever has less education.
- Okay, guys, thank you for the offers.

179
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,000
But i want you to get pumped
about this corner idea.

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,100
All right? One, two, three,

181
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600

182
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Corner idea.

183
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,900
No, you're supposed to
say rock the house!

184
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,500
- Rock the house.
- How would we know that?

185
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,000
Hey, dude,

186
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,300
do you know what a rundown is?

187
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,200

189
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,000

I don't know. But it sounds like
the rundown is really important.

192
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,500
Charles asked me to do this
rundown Of all my clients.

193
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,900
Why don't you just ask him--

194
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,200
No, i can't. It was, like, hours ago.

195
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,400

196
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,600
Try another sentence.

parking lot In front of a cop.

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,600

- They're shaped like paper.

309
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
It's still a little choppy like.
But don't worry, it's hard.

310
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,300
I mean, it took me a while too. It's like...

Who would have thought

that the thing That would save
this company would be work?

376
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,200
And pancakes.

377
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,800
In the end, this day
definitely had its ups and downs.

378
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,700
I realize that we don't
have the biggest office.

379
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,600
Which is a surprise because
165 square feet Sounds like a lot...

380
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,000
But we have people
with the biggest hearts.

381
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,600
And i think for a small
company, that is real--

382
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,000
Someone went to the bathroom.

383
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,200
That is really what's important.

384
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,900
Literally, every song is better
a cappella. Name a song.

385
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Cherry pie. Warrant.

386
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,800
- Better a cappella.
- No.

387
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
- Really?
- Yeah. Name another.

388
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,400
<i>Enter sandman. Metallica.</i>

389
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,500
Better a cappella.

390
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,600
<i>Rebel yell. Billy idol.</i>

391
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,500
Oh, way better a cappella.

392
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,900
- Really?
- Yeah.
