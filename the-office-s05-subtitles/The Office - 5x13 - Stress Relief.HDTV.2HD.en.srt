00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:24,856
Last week I gave a fire safety talk.

2
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,119
And nobody paid any attention.

3
00:00:29,021 --> 00:00:31,279
It's my own fault
for using <i>Powerpoint</i>.

4
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,906
<i>Powerpoint</i> is boring.

5
00:00:33,393 --> 00:00:35,634
People learn
in lots of different ways,

6
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,036
but experience

7
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:38,704
is the best teacher.

8
00:00:44,283 --> 00:00:46,702
Today, smoking is gonna save lives.

9
00:01:06,418 --> 00:01:08,618
Does anyone smell anything smoky?

10
00:01:08,743 --> 00:01:10,993
Did you bring your jerky in again?

11
00:01:16,106 --> 00:01:17,156
Oh, my god!

12
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,121
Fire!

13
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,673
Fire! My goodness.
What's the procedure?

14
00:01:22,798 --> 00:01:25,084
- What do we do, people?
- The phones are dead.

15
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:27,178
- How did that happen?
- It's out in the hall.

16
00:01:27,303 --> 00:01:29,573
We don't know. Smoke
could come through an air duct.

17
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,301
My god! OK, it's happening.

18
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:33,485
Everybody stay calm.
What's the procedure, everyone?

19
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,050
- What's the procedure? Stay calm!
- Wait, wait!

20
00:01:36,175 --> 00:01:38,055
Everybody, now calm down!

21
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:43,384
Touch the handle. If it's hot,
there could be a fire in the hallway.

22
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:45,908
What does warm mean?

23
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,724
Not a viable option.

24
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:49,316
- What next?
- Don't run!

25
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,612
Here's a door. Check that one out.

26
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,677
- How's the handle?
- It's warm.

27
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:55,488
Well... another option.

28
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:57,128
Back to our options, jeez!

29
00:01:57,253 --> 00:01:58,868
Settle down. No bunching.

30
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,489
- I forgot my purse.
- Leave it!

31
00:02:00,614 --> 00:02:01,790
Get out of the way!

32
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,616
Things can be replaced, Phyllis.
People, human lives... However, can...

33
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,503
My hand! That's hot!

34
00:02:10,843 --> 00:02:12,217
This one's hot, too!

35
00:02:12,342 --> 00:02:14,223
We're trapped.
Everyone for himself!

36
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:15,256
Let's go!

37
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,970
- Out of my way!
- Let's go! Get out of my way.

38
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,217
- Calm, please.
- Get out of the way!

39
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,327
Have you ever seen a burn victim?

40
00:02:22,452 --> 00:02:25,060
- Move it!
- Procedure, procedure!

41
00:02:26,022 --> 00:02:28,384
Exit options.
Where do we go, folks?

42
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,244
Use a what to cover the mouth?

43
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:31,834
A what?
A rag.

44
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:33,435
A damp rag, perhaps.

45
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,862
Just remember those procedures.

46
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:37,553
What are the options?

47
00:02:37,678 --> 00:02:39,909
That's a wrong way.
We've already tried that.

48
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,770
Remember your exit points.

49
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,204
Exit points, people. What's next?

50
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,914
Stay alive, I'm getting help!

51
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:47,457
- Pull me up!
- Too heavy!

52
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:48,917
I only weigh 82 pounds.

53
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,978
Save bandit!

54
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,693
How about 911?

55
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:56,884
Anyone? 911.

56
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,846
What do we do?

57
00:03:08,971 --> 00:03:12,482
Use surge of fear and adrenaline
to sharpen your decision-making.

58
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,609
I am not dying here. Come on.

59
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:22,134
- What is that? What is that?
- The fire's shooting at us!

60
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:24,623
What in the name of god is going on?

61
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:29,834
Battering ram.

62
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,742
Help!

63
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,222
I'm about to die!

64
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,290
Attention!

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,188
Employees of <i>Dunder Mifflin</i>.

66
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:55,571
This has been a test
of our emergency preparedness.

67
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:58,209
There is no fire.
It was only a simulation.

68
00:03:58,334 --> 00:03:59,134
What?

69
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,324
Fire not real.
This was merely a training exercise.

70
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,368
So, what have we learned?

71
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,831
Come on. It's not real, Stanley.
Don't have a heart attack.

72
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:11,749
No! You will not die.

73
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:14,648
- You will not die.
- Call 911.

74
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,372
Barack is president!

75
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:18,952
You are black!

76
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,647
- I'm gonna give him mouth-to-mouth.
- Don't give him for this.

77
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:23,179
He's gonna swallow his tongue.

78
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,519
Open your mouth!
Don't swallow it.

79
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:28,520
- You're choking him!
- I'm fine, leave me alone!

80
00:04:28,645 --> 00:04:30,026
Leave him alone!

81
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:31,270
I'm saving him!

Episode 5x13
"Stress Relief"

85
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,595
How could you possibly think
this is a good idea?

86
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:08,155
A lot of ideas were not
appreciated in their time.

87
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,683
- Electricity.
- Shampoo.

88
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,612
You could have burned
the whole building.

89
00:05:11,737 --> 00:05:14,437
I just wanna say for the record,
I did not kill anyone.

90
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:16,366
Stanley was attacked
by his own heart.

91
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:19,999
He should be released from the hospital
and back in the office in a couple days.

92
00:05:20,124 --> 00:05:22,988
Did you shout, "fire!",
causing a panic?

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,541
Yes, I shouted, "fire!"

94
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,207
I shouted many things.

95
00:05:26,332 --> 00:05:29,333
I also shouted instructions
on how to get out of the building,

96
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,914
so you can imagine my frustration
as safety officer

97
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,880
when nobody would heed of what...

98
00:05:34,005 --> 00:05:35,958
- heeded... heeded of...
- Hed. Hedded.

99
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,790
- When no one hedded...
- Take hedded of.

100
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:39,979
No one would take
"hedded" of my instructions.

101
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:42,227
- Heed. Take heed of.
- So you...

102
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,471
- And I don't see my coworkers...
- Take heed of.

103
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:46,429
heeding this right now.

104
00:05:49,544 --> 00:05:50,366
What?

105
00:06:04,485 --> 00:06:05,585
This city...

106
00:06:10,612 --> 00:06:12,520
We aren't mad,
we're just disappointed.

107
00:06:12,645 --> 00:06:13,965
No, we are mad.

108
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,377
Yes. We are.

109
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,801
We are livid.

110
00:06:16,926 --> 00:06:18,743
But we're going
to let this one slide.

111
00:06:18,868 --> 00:06:20,209
- Thank you.
- We're not!

112
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,306
I'm not a mind-reader, David.

113
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,593
Look, this is
a very serious offense.

114
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,805
We have cause to fire you.

115
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,380
Can you shove down?

116
00:06:31,068 --> 00:06:32,068
Instead...

117
00:06:33,332 --> 00:06:34,541
Shove down, please.

118
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:36,519
Instead, what I think we should do

119
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:39,499
is strip you of your title
as safety officer.

120
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,763
And we should take
a part of his pay

121
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:44,168
and donate it
to the charity of your choice.

122
00:06:44,293 --> 00:06:46,498
- Something that Dwight doesn't like.
- <i>PETA</i>.

123
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,749
Michael, you have to take
responsibility here.

124
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,286
One of your employees
had a heart attack.

125
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,539
He could have died because of the way
you're allowing your office to run.

126
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,958
- Do you want that on your conscience?
- Do you?

127
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,299
- You talking to me?
- Yeah.

128
00:07:02,114 --> 00:07:02,930
What?

129
00:07:05,505 --> 00:07:06,380
Well...

130
00:07:06,505 --> 00:07:09,155
I guess we papered over that
pretty nicely.

131
00:07:09,781 --> 00:07:12,372
It amuses me when corporate thinks
they can make big change

132
00:07:12,497 --> 00:07:15,347
with a 20 min meeting
in some fancy high-rise.

133
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,509
What's the matter?
You hungry?

134
00:07:19,574 --> 00:07:21,274
No, Dwight, I'm worried.

135
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,233
A man's life is in my hands.

136
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,202
Don't you worry about that.
I got it covered.

137
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:31,074
I am planning a bomb scare. That should
really get the blood pumping.

138
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,693
That's not gonna happen.

139
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:34,327
I'm taking over as safety man.

140
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,381
- What? You? Come on.
- Yes.

141
00:07:37,506 --> 00:07:39,755
- I'm smart. I'll figure it out.
- That's preposterous.

142
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,730
I will.

143
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:45,354
Nobody should have
to go to work thinking,

144
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:48,621
"This is the place
that I might die today."

145
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,242
That's what a hospital is for.

146
00:07:51,693 --> 00:07:52,793
An office...

147
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:54,967
is for not dying.

148
00:07:56,414 --> 00:07:58,214
An office is a place to...

149
00:07:59,473 --> 00:08:01,212
live life to the fullest,

150
00:08:01,337 --> 00:08:02,687
to the max, to...

151
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:07,256
An office is a place

152
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:09,125
where dreams come true.

153
00:08:11,498 --> 00:08:12,767
Don't excite him.

154
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:14,642
Don't make him excitable.

155
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:18,954
Welcome back.

156
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:20,544
Thank you.

157
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,167
It's true.

158
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:23,869
Around this office, in the past,

159
00:08:23,994 --> 00:08:25,962
I've been a little
abrupt with people.

160
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,631
Not maybe. Yes or no.

161
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:28,715
No way.

162
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,217
Are you from another planet?

163
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:32,678
Have you lost your mind?
Cause I'll help you find it.

164
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:35,556
Did I stutter?
I'm done. Good-bye.

165
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:39,768
But the doctor said
if I can't find a new way

166
00:08:39,893 --> 00:08:42,400
to relate more positively
to my surroundings,

167
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,771
i'm going to die.

168
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:46,567
A throne for your highness.

169
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:50,356
I'm not sitting in a wheelchair.

170
00:08:50,481 --> 00:08:52,738
No, no debate. You're going
to sit in that wheelchair

171
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,808
until you're back on your feet.

172
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:56,994
I'm going to die.

173
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,240
A, b, c... OK?

174
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:02,928
And that stands for airway,
breathing, and circulation.

175
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:04,991
You know what?
That could be a little confusing

176
00:09:05,116 --> 00:09:07,805
because in sales, a, b, c
means "always be closing."

177
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,089
This is a farce. I should be
teaching this course.

178
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,187
Shut it.

179
00:09:11,312 --> 00:09:14,743
We found ourselves
on the less-prepared side of things

180
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,561
when Stanley had his...

181
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,579
When his heart went berserk.

182
00:09:18,704 --> 00:09:20,436
And I knew exactly what to do,

183
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:22,372
but in a much more real sense,

184
00:09:22,497 --> 00:09:24,184
I had no idea what to do.

185
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:27,187
So I thought we should have
a CPR training class.

186
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:30,899
And of course you can't get
the practice dummy

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,570
unless the instructor
comes along with it.

188
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,908
Red cross, you know, racket.

189
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:40,189
I can't keep doing this forever.

190
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,814
It's been 20 seconds.

191
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:44,718
Call it.

192
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:46,876
Would you like to try next?

193
00:09:47,046 --> 00:09:48,696
Absolutely I would not.

194
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,271
You know,
who I really think should go?

195
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:52,695
Stanley.

196
00:09:53,163 --> 00:09:54,258
I don't know.

197
00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:57,094
It's not a good idea.
He needs to rest.

198
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,813
No rest for the sick.

199
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:03,623
We are not always going to be there

200
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,685
to coddle your heart back

201
00:10:07,618 --> 00:10:09,818
when it disappears to be working.

202
00:10:09,956 --> 00:10:12,653
What are you gonna do if you're
by yourself and your heart stops?

203
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:13,889
I would die.

204
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:15,421
And you're OK with that?

205
00:10:15,546 --> 00:10:17,446
I'm OK with the logic of it.

206
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,939
Come on. Get up. Let's do this.

207
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:22,208
Yes, I had a heart attack.

208
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,164
I would quit, but I'm too old
to find another job.

209
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,250
And I don't have
enough saved to retire.

210
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:30,305
I feel like I'm working
at my own casket.

211
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,771
Come on! You're losing you.

212
00:10:32,896 --> 00:10:34,632
You're losing you. Do it!

213
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,135
This is you we're talking about.

214
00:10:37,864 --> 00:10:39,309
OK. I'll show them.

215
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,484
Here we go.

216
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:42,932
All right.

217
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:45,560
So assessing the situation,
are they breathing?

218
00:10:46,289 --> 00:10:47,289
No, Rose.

219
00:10:48,016 --> 00:10:49,336
They are not breathing.

220
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:51,511
And they have no arms or legs.

221
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,405
- That's not part of it.
- Where are they?

222
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:58,031
You know what? If we come across
somebody with no arms or legs,

223
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:00,349
do we bother resuscitating them?

224
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,412
What kind of quality of life
do we have there?

225
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,497
- I would wanna live with no legs.
- How about no arms?

226
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,174
No arms or legs is basically
how you exist right now.

227
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:10,585
You don't do anything.

228
00:11:10,908 --> 00:11:14,308
All right, let's get back to it,
cause you're losing him.

229
00:11:14,937 --> 00:11:15,937
Too fast.

230
00:11:16,062 --> 00:11:19,612
Everyone, we need to pump at a pace
of 100 beats per minute.

231
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,346
That's hard to keep track.
How many is that per hour?

232
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,890
- How's that gonna help you?
- I'll divide and count to it.

233
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,921
Right.

234
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,062
A good trick is to pump to the tune
of <i>Staying Alive</i> by the <i>Bee Gees</i>.

235
00:11:30,187 --> 00:11:32,607
- Do you know that song?
- Yes, I do. I love that song.

236
00:11:36,755 --> 00:11:37,805
No, it's...

237
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,870
You were in the parking lot earlier.
That's how I know you.

238
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,905
You didn't maintain
100 beats per minute,

239
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:23,991
and ambulance didn't arrive
cause nobody called 911.

240
00:12:24,161 --> 00:12:26,461
- So you lost him.
- OK. He's dead.

241
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,496
Anyone know what we do next?
Anybody? Rose?

242
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:31,461
- No idea.
- Anyone else?

243
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:32,834
- Bury him.
- Wrong!

244
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,403
Check for organ donor card.

245
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:36,463
If he has one,
we only have min to harvest.

246
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:37,756
No wallet. I checked.

247
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,373
- He's an organ donor.
- He is?

248
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:41,560
Give me some ice
and a styrofoam bucket.

249
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:42,735
Here we go.

250
00:12:43,684 --> 00:12:44,534
My god!

251
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,159
What are you doing?!

252
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,063
We search for the organs.
Where's the heart? The precious heart.

253
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,647
I'm not feeling well.
I need to sit down.

254
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:57,892
Are you OK?

255
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:01,288
Oh, my god!

256
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,623
Daddy?

257
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:04,866
My god!

258
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,285
Can you tell me why you had to
cut the face off the dummy?

259
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,784
I didn't think it was
very realistic in the movie,

260
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:13,204
and it turns out,
it's pretty realistic.

261
00:13:13,477 --> 00:13:15,877
We had to pay for it.
Cost us $3,500.

262
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:18,023
$5,300 for a dummy?

263
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,183
Look.

264
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,170
This is why...

265
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:24,712
we have training.

266
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:26,615
We start with the dummy,

267
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,537
and learn from our mistakes.

268
00:13:28,662 --> 00:13:30,089
And now Dwight knows

269
00:13:30,214 --> 00:13:32,727
not to cut the face off
of a real person.

270
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:42,631
Hope you brought your appetitos,
my lady, my tuna.

271
00:13:43,955 --> 00:13:45,605
A little movie popcorn.

272
00:13:49,393 --> 00:13:50,293
Damn it.

273
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:52,807
This movie, a lot of buzz.

274
00:13:53,022 --> 00:13:55,249
Not coming out for another 6 months.

275
00:13:55,651 --> 00:13:57,546
<i>Mrs. Albert Hannaday.</i>

276
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,381
Friendship with the nerd dog
has its privileges.

277
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,432
We don't normally
download films illegally.

278
00:14:05,557 --> 00:14:07,593
Cause we're honest,
hard-working people.

279
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:09,231
And we don't know how.

280
00:14:09,356 --> 00:14:11,667
But Andy does, so we have
to watch it with him.

281
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,642
Punishment fits the crime.

282
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,905
<i>And I want you to meet my nana.</i>

283
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,830
<i>Nana?</i>

284
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:19,715
<i>This...</i>

285
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,690
<i>is Sam.</i>

286
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:24,408
<i>Nice to meet you, Mrs. Hannaday.</i>

287
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,283
<i>Please... Call me "Lily."</i>

288
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:35,831
<i>Let's play bridge.</i>

289
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,953
<i>You can be my partner.</i>

290
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:40,271
<i>All right...</i>

291
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:41,824
<i>Lily.</i>

292
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,268
What's going on?

293
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,425
No one really knows,
but Pam's parents

294
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:00,022
are going through a bit of a rough patch
in their marriage.

295
00:15:00,192 --> 00:15:02,822
My dad spent the night
at our place last night.

296
00:15:02,947 --> 00:15:05,224
My parents have been
fighting for weeks and...

297
00:15:05,349 --> 00:15:06,599
it kinda sucks.

298
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:08,201
Jim's been great.

299
00:15:09,172 --> 00:15:11,722
But I'm gonna need
to buy my dad a robe.

300
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:14,646
He's not saying
what he needs to say.

301
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:17,495
Who? Jack Black?

302
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,239
I mean, they just need
to communicate, you know?

303
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:27,048
If they said to each other what they're
saying to everyone else, then...

304
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:32,606
Jim and Pam

305
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,709
are, like, movie geniuses.

306
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:40,631
They're catching things
that are totally going over my head.

307
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:42,829
Hi, everyone.

308
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:46,411
Corporate has given Dwight...
two strikes.

309
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:48,836
They are very, very upset with him.

310
00:15:49,324 --> 00:15:50,156
So...

311
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,075
as a disciplinary measure,

312
00:15:52,871 --> 00:15:54,684
he is going to have to issue

313
00:15:54,809 --> 00:15:56,159
a formal apology.

314
00:15:57,711 --> 00:15:59,027
Have you prepared

315
00:15:59,152 --> 00:16:00,786
your statement of regret?

316
00:16:00,911 --> 00:16:02,334
- I have.
- Let's hear it.

317
00:16:07,121 --> 00:16:08,621
"I state my regret."

318
00:16:10,899 --> 00:16:13,889
- You couldn't have memorized that?
- I could not because I did not feel it.

319
00:16:14,342 --> 00:16:17,442
OK, everyone. I am going to need you
to sign this statement of regret

320
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,310
as an acknowledgment
that you heard it.

321
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:21,763
OK? Everyone come on up here.
It's not a big deal.

322
00:16:21,888 --> 00:16:24,149
It is a big deal.
You almost killed Stanley.

323
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:27,187
Right. I filled him full
of butter and sugar for 50 years

324
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:29,021
and forced him not to exercise.

325
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:32,531
Now, take a lesson from Stanley
and jog on up here and sign this.

326
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:34,311
Make a line.

327
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,037
Just form a line right here.

328
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:38,639
Sign it!

329
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,664
Sign it now!

330
00:16:43,686 --> 00:16:44,686
Hi, dad.

331
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,621
Yeah, Jim has shaving cream.
Check our bathroom.

332
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:50,448
<i>Lily?</i>

333
00:16:51,644 --> 00:16:52,744
<i>I'm in here.</i>

334
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,644
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't...</i>

335
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:04,932
<i>Realize you were in the bath.</i>

336
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,245
<i>Do you want me to go?</i>

337
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,522
<i>I want you to stay.</i>

338
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,639
Give me a break.

339
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,575
I know it, man.

340
00:17:27,272 --> 00:17:29,922
You know, Lily was supposed
to be Nicole Kidman.

341
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:34,073
And it was gonna be Sophie's mom,
not grandmother.

342
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:38,254
But then Nicole Kidman dropped out
so they went with Cloris Leachman

343
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,066
with a small rewrite.

344
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:42,306
<i>Get that in there.</i>

345
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:43,609
<i>Put it around me.</i>

346
00:17:43,734 --> 00:17:45,458
<i>- Yeah.
- Get that done already.</i>

347
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,332
<i>I know, but if I get it deeper...</i>

348
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,457
What is...

349
00:17:54,164 --> 00:17:56,514
He was pretty talkative
at breakfast.

350
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,526
Wha... brea...

351
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,538
Breakfast?

352
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,499
You mean when they were eating soup?

353
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,840
I don't think that was breakfast.

354
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:10,715
Unless soup... does soup
symbolize breakfast?

355
00:18:11,399 --> 00:18:14,840
So he doesn't share with his daughter,
but shares with his daughter's fiance?

356
00:18:14,965 --> 00:18:17,265
OK, you guys... They're making out.

357
00:18:22,156 --> 00:18:24,309
Did my dad say anything
about my mom?

358
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:25,712
Nope.

359
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:28,137
We mostly just talked about cereal.

360
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,067
What?

361
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:32,935
I don't know.

362
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,909
I mean, maybe he'll talk to you
about some of this stuff

363
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:38,684
cause he can't really
talk to me about it.

364
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,951
You're good to talk to.

365
00:18:42,363 --> 00:18:43,214
I'm OK.

366
00:18:43,457 --> 00:18:45,081
I'm not... great.

367
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,050
And...

368
00:18:55,102 --> 00:18:58,152
Everybody sit on the floor,
indian-style, like me.

369
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:00,105
Om... my god,

370
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,696
if you're wearing a dress,
please keep your knees together.

371
00:19:02,821 --> 00:19:04,571
Nobody wants to see that.

372
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,664
My goal is to make this office

373
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:11,739
as peaceful a place
for Stanley Hudson as I can.

374
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:15,658
And I think sounds
have a lot to do with that.

375
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,899
Here are some downloaded
peaceful sounds.

376
00:19:25,863 --> 00:19:27,663
That one makes me think...

377
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:29,877
of death.

378
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,588
That's kind of nice.

379
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:35,657
It is...

380
00:19:36,374 --> 00:19:37,474
a beautiful,

381
00:19:38,069 --> 00:19:39,152
sunny day

382
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:40,875
as we walk

383
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:43,021
through the meadow.

384
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,000
It is very...

385
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,283
spiritual

386
00:19:46,597 --> 00:19:49,479
and relaxing, and there are flowers,

387
00:19:50,135 --> 00:19:52,185
and it is sunny and beautiful.

388
00:19:52,656 --> 00:19:54,086
Now, up ahead,

389
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,258
a castle in the distance.

390
00:19:56,383 --> 00:19:58,513
- Don't open your eyes.
- What?

391
00:19:58,638 --> 00:19:59,795
And you walk up

392
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,613
toward the castle,

393
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:04,520
and inside the castle

394
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:05,728
are...

395
00:20:05,881 --> 00:20:06,681
four

396
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,359
men.

397
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,300
And each of them...

398
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,125
None of them have shoes.

399
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,500
And they give you a funny cigarette,

400
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,910
and you feel even more relaxed.

401
00:20:17,035 --> 00:20:19,357
And then you want ice cream.

402
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,881
You want a big bowl of ice cream.

403
00:20:22,006 --> 00:20:23,805
So what kind do you want?
Yell it out.

404
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,932
- <i>Chunky monkey</i>.
- Too expensive.

405
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,049
- Chocolate.
- Racism is dead.

406
00:20:28,174 --> 00:20:30,680
You can have any kind
of ice cream you want.

407
00:20:30,805 --> 00:20:32,155
What do you want?

408
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,880
What is that? People.

409
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,942
I told you to get rid
of the cell phones.

410
00:20:36,315 --> 00:20:38,352
It's my biofeedback machine.

411
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:41,626
What is that? Like a video game?

412
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,116
It alerts me
when my stress level goes up

413
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,202
so I can try to calm down.

414
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,800
You have stress?

415
00:20:49,203 --> 00:20:51,249
During our relaxation exercise?

416
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,928
- Let me get you some water.
- No, I'll help you.

417
00:20:54,053 --> 00:20:55,091
Here we go.

418
00:20:55,549 --> 00:20:58,548
- Let me get you up.
- Would you step back? Please.

419
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,066
A little further.

420
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:18,087
I think that thing is on the fritz.

421
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:22,822
Would you reach over
and touch his thing?

422
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,067
That's what he said. Right, guys?

423
00:21:25,192 --> 00:21:26,432
'Cause of gay.

424
00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:29,859
Let's give this a shot.

425
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:39,422
I think you're
what's stressing everybody out.

426
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,759
So it wasn't Dwight after all.

427
00:21:44,444 --> 00:21:46,294
Looks like I am the killer.

428
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,973
You never expect
that you're the killer. It's a...

429
00:21:50,238 --> 00:21:51,338
great twist.

430
00:21:52,015 --> 00:21:53,115
Great twist.

431
00:21:57,152 --> 00:21:59,052
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

432
00:21:59,817 --> 00:22:00,817
Hey, Mom.

433
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,182
What did Dad say?

434
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:11,788
What did you say to my dad?

435
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:14,534
- What?
- After you talked, he called my mom

436
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,626
and said he was gonna look
for an apartment.

437
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:18,194
Pam, I don't know.

438
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:20,645
Nothing.

439
00:22:20,866 --> 00:22:23,633
Truly, nothing.
I just was honest with him and I...

440
00:22:24,602 --> 00:22:26,452
I'm so sorry, I don't know.

441
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,221
I'll call him again.

442
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:35,339
50% of marriages end in divorce.

443
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:36,761
So...

444
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:40,389
it was her parents or my parents.

445
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:46,606
What could Jim have said
to make my dad want to leave my mom?

446
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:50,535
And at what point in our marriage
is he gonna say it to me?

447
00:22:55,717 --> 00:22:56,967
I don't get it.

448
00:22:58,345 --> 00:22:59,845
Do I stress you out?

449
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,670
Nothing stresses me out.

450
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,049
Except having to seek
the approval of my inferiors.

451
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,753
Speaking of which...

452
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:15,243
Remember
when people used to say "boss"

453
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,078
when they were describing
something that was really cool?

454
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:20,188
Like...

455
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,933
"Those shoulder pads
are really boss, man."

456
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:27,575
"Look at that perm.
That perm is so boss."

457
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,191
It's what made me want
to become a boss.

458
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,009
And I looked so good
in a perm and shoulder pads.

459
00:23:36,426 --> 00:23:38,291
But now, boss is just...

460
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:39,955
slang for...

461
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,149
"jerk in charge."

462
00:23:43,284 --> 00:23:45,384
OK, everybody. I figured it out.

463
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:47,395
The reason

464
00:23:47,913 --> 00:23:51,533
that you are all so stressed around me
is that you are too intimidated

465
00:23:51,658 --> 00:23:54,223
to tell me what you really think.

466
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:58,519
You are keeping these feelings inside,
and that is causing stress.

467
00:23:58,825 --> 00:24:00,425
So, what is a solution?

468
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,650
Solution is honesty,

469
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:05,276
laughter, and comedy. In short...

470
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,401
Vacation.

471
00:24:06,918 --> 00:24:07,820
What? No.

472
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:10,839
I am talking about a roast!

473
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:13,034
Of Michael Scott.

474
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:16,579
Come on! Who here has
the <i>Comedy Central</i> roast channel?

475
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,362
You've seen it, right?
Everybody gets together,

476
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:22,153
and you start hurling insults
at the one guy,

477
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,797
and everybody's laughing,
and everybody is hugging each other.

478
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,091
Are you serious?
You really want us to roast you?

479
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:30,718
- <i>Si, señor.</i>
- That's offensive.

480
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,772
It's not!
It's not offensive during a roast.

481
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,758
Anything goes and I want you guys
to really get cracking on this.

482
00:24:36,883 --> 00:24:39,685
I want you to take me down.
Don't hold back.

483
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,353
I want you to really

484
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:44,775
make fun of anything about me.
It could be my race,

485
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,290
could be the fact that I'm so fit,
or I'm a womanizer.

486
00:24:48,811 --> 00:24:50,198
Fair game. Whatever.

487
00:24:50,323 --> 00:24:52,189
I don't want to write
your stuff for you.

488
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:53,908
But I just want it to be good.

489
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,306
I consider myself a good person.

490
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,793
But I'm gonna try to make him cry.

491
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,026
I can already feel
people's stress starting to melt.

492
00:25:09,151 --> 00:25:12,568
I think they're very excited
about paying their respects this way.

493
00:25:12,968 --> 00:25:14,731
I have got to make sure

494
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,829
that YouTube comes down
to tape this.

495
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,020
May I have your attention?

496
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,315
Sign in on the sign-in sheet.
The clipboard.

497
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,128
This is mandatory. If you don't sign in,
your name will not be counted.

498
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:34,711
This is your apology letter.

499
00:25:35,396 --> 00:25:37,118
The last signature I needed.

500
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,956
Welcome, welcome, welcome!

501
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,524
You are all jerks.

502
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,040
Just kidding. Not yet, anyway.

503
00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:50,405
Welcome to the roast
of Mr. Michael Scott.

504
00:25:50,725 --> 00:25:54,051
If you're here for the Gravoski wedding,
it is the second door on the left.

505
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:58,848
So we all know how these work.
Needs to get crazy.

506
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,433
Take your best shots.

507
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,039
I am going to sit right over "chair"

508
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,639
Whoever wants to come up
and roast me, you may.

509
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:12,732
Lower the mic for the midget.

510
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:16,670
If you ever wondered

511
00:26:16,795 --> 00:26:20,045
whether you were Michael Scott,
here's a quiz to help.

512
00:26:20,369 --> 00:26:22,622
If you ever put
sunblock on a window,

513
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,640
you might be Michael Scott.

514
00:26:26,702 --> 00:26:29,402
I normally don't enjoy
making people laugh.

515
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,132
If you ever called
the fire department

516
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,052
cause your head was stuck
in your chair, you might be...

517
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:45,628
I don't go make burgers
where you work

518
00:26:45,753 --> 00:26:48,203
and then tell you
how to make burgers.

519
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,894
I have made a list of people
that I would make out with

520
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:54,291
before I would make out
with Michael Scott.

521
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:56,113
A turtle. A fridge.

522
00:26:57,014 --> 00:26:58,864
Anybody from the warehouse.

523
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:00,567
A wood chipper.

524
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:01,536
Kevin.

525
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,204
A candle.

526
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,030
And Lord Voldemort.

527
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,458
Anyway, happy birthday, Michael!

528
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,026
You'd be so lucky!

529
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:10,377
Good one.

530
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:14,659
You ran over me with your car.

531
00:27:16,653 --> 00:27:19,419
You posted a picture
of my bare boobs

532
00:27:19,544 --> 00:27:23,224
on the bulletin board
with a caption that said, "gross."

533
00:27:25,239 --> 00:27:27,019
You are the reason I drink.

534
00:27:27,306 --> 00:27:29,848
You are the reason I live to forget.

535
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,210
Friends only.

536
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,774
Several times a day,
Michael says words

537
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,224
words that are way
beyond my vocabulary.

538
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,849
- I know where this is going.
- Do you?

539
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,347
Remember "spider face"?

540
00:27:55,472 --> 00:27:58,872
'Cause the quote was,
"cut off your nose to spider face."

541
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:05,593
How dare you all
attack him like this?

542
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,269
- Stop it.
- Michael is your superior.

543
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:11,140
You should be bowing down
in front of him.

544
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:13,403
OK? They don't understand
who they have.

545
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:16,457
You're interrupting me.
I am trying to get your back.

546
00:28:16,582 --> 00:28:19,822
Are you calling me an idiot?
Don't you ever talk to me that way.

547
00:28:20,121 --> 00:28:21,981
You pathetic, short little man.

548
00:28:22,106 --> 00:28:25,306
You don't have any friends
or any family or any land.

549
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,045
I just want to take a minute to talk
about something very serious.

550
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:35,705
Once every hour,

551
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:38,624
someone is involved
in an Internet scam.

552
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:41,291
That man is Michael Scott.

553
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,749
He's supporting
about 20 Nigerian princesses.

554
00:28:44,874 --> 00:28:46,074
You know what?

555
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:48,361
Forgive me for caring, right?

556
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,845
Michael is a great delegator.

557
00:28:52,174 --> 00:28:54,674
He never does any work himself...
ever.

558
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,018
And one time
I walked in on him naked.

559
00:29:00,091 --> 00:29:01,891
And his thing is so small.

560
00:29:02,271 --> 00:29:03,837
How small is it?

561
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,692
If it were an iPod,
it would be a Shuffle.

562
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:09,867
Can I make
just a little announcement?

563
00:29:09,992 --> 00:29:12,030
In a professional roast, usually

564
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:16,150
the roaster will say something nice
about the roastee after they're done.

565
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,560
Something about
how much they love them.

566
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,418
So just keep that in mind.

567
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,830
Mike claims

568
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:24,777
- we're all a family.
- We are! We are a family.

569
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,225
What's his name?
All the way in the back, there.

570
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,443
Very funny.

571
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:32,246
What's his name?

572
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:36,249
I'm thinking Roy.

573
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,151
Roy left years ago.
What's his name?

574
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,746
I don't believe
I have had the pleasure.

575
00:29:41,871 --> 00:29:45,324
I gave you a ride home last week
and we spent an hour in traffic.

576
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,592
- What's his name?
- Jefferson.

577
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,621
His name is Michael.

578
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,090
<i>What I hate about you</i>

579
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,784
<i>You really suck as a boss</i>

580
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,830
<i>You're the losiest, jerkiest
And you're dumber than applesauce</i>

581
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,705
<i>We're stuck listening to you all day</i>

582
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,315
<i>Stanley tried to die
just to get away</i>

583
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,733
<i>Well, it's true</i>

584
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,540
<i>That's what I hate about you</i>

585
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,601
<i>That's what I hate about you</i>

586
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,728
And now...

587
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:42,631
a man who deserves no introduction.

588
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:49,332
Thank you very much.

589
00:30:49,701 --> 00:30:51,501
Thank you. That was great.

590
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:53,576
Great job, some great laughs.

591
00:30:55,247 --> 00:30:56,247
Really...

592
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,960
Really went
after my intelligence, there.

593
00:31:01,477 --> 00:31:04,361
Dozens of online I.Q. tests
might prove you wrong...

594
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,939
And my thing isn't...

595
00:31:08,064 --> 00:31:09,575
tiny, it's average, so.

596
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,654
Get your facts straight.

597
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:19,133
When I heard that there was going
to be a roast in my honor

598
00:31:20,187 --> 00:31:21,287
I thought...

599
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:22,865
Sorry.

600
00:31:23,924 --> 00:31:25,618
I have a frog in my throat.

601
00:31:30,284 --> 00:31:34,183
I decided to jot down
some quick thoughts about you people.

602
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:40,044
First up,

603
00:31:40,336 --> 00:31:41,736
Phyllis and Kevin.

604
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,579
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

605
00:32:12,091 --> 00:32:15,541
Sorry, Michael's not here right now.
Can I take a message?

606
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,893
Great. I will. Thanks.

607
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:26,350
It's very unusual for Michael
not to show up to work.

608
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:28,552
My guess...
He's either deeply depressed

609
00:32:28,677 --> 00:32:32,127
or an icicle has snapped off his roof
and impaled his brain.

610
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,005
He has this terrible habit
of standing directly underneath them

611
00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:38,563
and staring up at them.
And I always say, "Michael,

612
00:32:38,688 --> 00:32:41,295
"take 2 steps back
and stare at the icicle from the side."

613
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,415
And he's like, "I like the way they look
from standing directly underneath them."

614
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:48,360
It was only a matter of time.

615
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,795
Michael is so dumb...

616
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,805
that he tries to put his M&Ms

617
00:32:54,066 --> 00:32:55,758
in alphabetical order.

618
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,629
All right, Kevin.

619
00:32:57,923 --> 00:33:00,769
Enough with the Michael jokes.
He got it bad enough yesterday.

620
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,772
- I'm almost done.
- That reeks, and I'm trying to eat.

621
00:33:04,387 --> 00:33:06,737
Attention, everyone.
I've just got a text from Michael.

622
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:09,028
He says, "personnel day."
Are we hiring?

623
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:12,781
- You're being replaced.
- I think he meant "personal day."

624
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,239
That's quite a leap.

625
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,112
I hope he's OK. I feel bad.

626
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:17,786
Give it up. He's dead.

627
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,194
He just send a text.

628
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:21,498
What's a text?

629
00:33:42,161 --> 00:33:43,760
You know, sometimes...

630
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,905
to get perspective...

631
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:50,215
I like to think about a spaceman
on a star incredibly far away.

632
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:53,552
And our problems don't matter to him

633
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:56,427
because we're just
a distant point of light.

634
00:33:57,755 --> 00:33:59,505
But he feels sorry for me.

635
00:34:00,395 --> 00:34:03,030
Because he has
an incredibly powerful microscope

636
00:34:03,155 --> 00:34:04,805
and he can see my face.

637
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,105
I'm OK.

638
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,484
No, I'm not.

639
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,803
Phyllis, there's a package for you.

640
00:34:19,087 --> 00:34:20,112
Sign here.

641
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:32,121
Got it.

642
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:36,841
<i>Sam...</i>

643
00:34:39,473 --> 00:34:42,316
<i>It's not that you dumped
my grand-daughter.</i>

644
00:34:42,441 --> 00:34:46,091
<i>And it's not that you want children.
It's that you lied to me.</i>

645
00:34:46,328 --> 00:34:47,543
<i>Can't you see that?</i>

646
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:49,115
<i>Can't you see?</i>

647
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:53,155
<i>- I'll never trust you.
- Lilly, no.</i>

648
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:55,948
<i>Lilly, please.</i>

649
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,336
<i>Lilly, stop!</i>

650
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:03,028
<i>I don't care
how much time we have left.</i>

651
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:06,419
<i>I don't care what my friends say.</i>

652
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:09,049
<i>I don't care what your mom thinks.</i>

653
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:12,815
<i>Frankly, I'm pretty sure
she's not making any sense.</i>

654
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,340
<i>Please...</i>

655
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:17,990
<i>Move back to my appartement.</i>

656
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,060
<i>I'm not giving up.</i>

657
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,279
<i>I'm not giving up.</i>

658
00:35:36,977 --> 00:35:38,677
<i>Push the reverse button!</i>

659
00:35:39,232 --> 00:35:40,679
<i>Reverse the button!</i>

660
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:49,915
Sam...

661
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:00,261
Hey, Dad.

662
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:03,319
No, I know Mom told me.

663
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:10,542
I'll see you then.

664
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,859
So, what did he say?

665
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:36,652
Was it my fault?

666
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,850
He said that you told him
how much you loved me.

667
00:36:46,032 --> 00:36:48,632
About how you feel
when I walk in a room.

668
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,207
And about...

669
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,692
how you've never doubted
for a second

670
00:36:52,817 --> 00:36:56,467
that I'm the woman you wanna spend
the rest of your life with.

671
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:01,911
I guess he has never felt that
with my mom even at their best.

672
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,012
You're OK?

673
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:11,478
When you're a kid, you assume
your parents are soulmates.

674
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,667
My kids are going to be
right about that.

675
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:18,573
I guess it also means that,
sometimes,

676
00:37:18,698 --> 00:37:21,948
love affairs look different
to the people inside them.

677
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:28,477
I'm not insightful enough
to be a movie critic.

678
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:31,127
Maybe I could be a food critic.

679
00:37:31,674 --> 00:37:33,474
"These muffins taste bad."

680
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:35,745
Or an art critic.

681
00:37:36,007 --> 00:37:37,657
"That painting is bad."

682
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:45,285
It's really good to see you.

683
00:37:46,573 --> 00:37:49,516
- Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
- You're all right?

684
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,461
- I feel I was a little harsh yesterday.
- Me too.

685
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:53,924
We're really sorry.

686
00:37:54,049 --> 00:37:56,148
I spend the afternoon in the park

687
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,941
trying to feed the pigeons.

688
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:01,049
I guess they all flew West
for the winter.

689
00:38:02,253 --> 00:38:04,907
I just had some thoughts
that I wanted to share with you.

690
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,490
- What?
- I wrote them down.

691
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:09,165
So I wouldn't forget.

692
00:38:11,186 --> 00:38:12,486
Jim, you're 6'11

693
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:16,877
and you weight 90 pounds.
Gumby has a better body than you.

694
00:38:17,811 --> 00:38:18,670
Roasted.

695
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,008
Dwight, you're a kiss ass.
Boom. Roasted.

696
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,717
Pam, you failed art school.
Boom. Roasted.

697
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:24,885
Meredith,

698
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,944
you've slept with so many guys
you're starting to look like one.

699
00:38:28,069 --> 00:38:29,669
Boom. Roasted.
Kevin,

700
00:38:29,794 --> 00:38:32,564
I can't decide between a fat joke
and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted.

701
00:38:32,689 --> 00:38:35,854
Creed, your teeth called:
your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted.

702
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,314
Where is Angela?

703
00:38:38,308 --> 00:38:41,740
There you are. I didn't see you
behind that grain of rice.

704
00:38:41,865 --> 00:38:43,111
Roasted. Stanley,

705
00:38:43,524 --> 00:38:45,989
you crush your wife during sex
and your heart sucks.

706
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,626
Roasted. Oscar,

707
00:38:47,905 --> 00:38:49,371
you are...

708
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:56,399
You're gay.

709
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:00,287
Andy, Cornell called,
they think you suck.

710
00:39:00,778 --> 00:39:02,678
And you're gayer than Oscar.

711
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,841
- Boom. Roasted.
- Boom. Roasted.

712
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:18,188
All right, everybody.
You know I can't.

713
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:21,273
You know I kid.

714
00:39:21,398 --> 00:39:24,998
You guys are the reason
that I went into the paper business.

715
00:39:26,789 --> 00:39:29,389
Good night. God bless.
God bless America.

716
00:39:29,514 --> 00:39:30,826
And get home safe.

717
00:39:34,831 --> 00:39:37,574
They say that laughter is
the best medecine, so...

718
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:41,142
Stanley, you can throw away
those pills. You're cured.

719
00:39:43,187 --> 00:39:44,700
Actually, you should...

720
00:39:44,825 --> 00:39:46,883
better hold on the pills,
just in case.

721
00:40:47,966 --> 00:40:50,262
<i>Every Thursday,
they bring their best.</i>

722
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:53,922
- You think you can pull that off?
- It'd be the performance of a lifetime.

723
00:40:54,047 --> 00:40:56,703
<i>With the moments
that can change lives.</i>

724
00:40:57,098 --> 00:40:58,413
<i>And surprises</i>

725
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:00,733
<i>that keep us guessing.</i>

726
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,334
<i>This Thursday.</i>

727
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,878
I'm trying to figure out the last time
you and Jim had sex.

728
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,255
<i>The shows you love, almost too much.</i>

729
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:10,133
- Then I'll put my mouth on his.
- I don't know what that means.

730
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,472
<i>All new comedy night done right.</i>

731
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,849
A blame.
<i>Thursday on NBC.</i>
