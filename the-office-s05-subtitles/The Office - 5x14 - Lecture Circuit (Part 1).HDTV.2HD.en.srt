00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
This morning, the phone guy comes in,

2
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,700
And he shows michael That
our phones have a p.A. Function.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
And then he just left.

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,000
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,600
<i>The office will be flying
At an altitude of two stories.</i>

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,500
<i>Look out your left-Hand window,</i>

7
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
<i>And you will see vance refrigeration.</i>

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,600
<i>I am the ghost of salesmen past.</i>

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,400
<i>Do not come near me!</i>

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,900
<i>Yes, michael scott
for dr. Jocelyn, please.</i>

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,900
<i>Hello, doctor.</i>

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,300
<i>I was just following up
about my mole again.</i>

13
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,700
<i>No, i was looking online
About sebaceous cysts.</i>

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>I have not been squeezing it.</i>

15
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,900
<i>Could i stick it with a pin?</i>

16
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,700
<i>Toby flenderson to
the principal's office.</i>

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:04,800
<i>Your mother called.</i>

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,900
<i>And it appears that
you wet the bed again.</i>

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,600
<i>So you have to get home
to wash your sheets</i>

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,400
<i>Because they're yellow and
they're wet With your urine.</i>

21

And at 6'6" From the university
of north carolina, Jim halpert!

22
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,100
That's pretty funny.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,800
Hey, you know what?
Did i drop my, uh...

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,500

- What the heck...

25
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:30,200
Is that, uh...

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
- You find it?
- I didn't.

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,600
I'll look somewhere else.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,800
- All right.
- All right.

29
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,900
Would you like fries with that?

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,400
Please drive around.

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Hello.

35
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
- Good morning.
- <i>Morning.</i>

36
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,400
You ready?

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
And we're off!

38
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Like a herd of turtles.

39
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, pam and i have eloped.

40
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,700
Actually, we just robbed a bank,

41
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,200
And we are on the lam.

42
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
No.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,600
seriously, i am on a lecture circuit.

44
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,500
Apparently scranton has the best
sales Of any regional branch,

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,400
So david wallace has asked me
To go to all the branches--

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,900
Except nashua,
so a little bit raw there--

47
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,000
but i am going to these branches

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,400
And i am telling them
my secret recipe for success.

49
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,800
My 11 business herbs and spices
In a sales batter.

50
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,700
that. Well, that is pam.

51
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,100
Pam is coming along as my assistant
And my driver so i can focus.

52
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,000
And i like to pack heavy.

53
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,300
He brought a sled.

54
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,100
No! That is a toboggan.

55
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,100
You never know when you're
gonna find a snowy hill.

56
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
So...

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,000
every magician has a hot assistant,
And every rock star has a roadie,

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
And pam is my hot roadie.

59
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Yeah. I love being on the road.

60
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,500
But i especially love
the time-And-A-Half pay,

61
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,300
24 hours a day, for three days.

62
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,100
'Cause i have a mortgage now.

63
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,200
Gotta bring home the bucks.

64
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,900
Yeah--Oh, don't say "bucks."
That's not ladylike.

65
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,800
<i>Here we go!</i>

66
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,200
Okay, so what we do

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,500
Is we drive all day

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,400
And we stay in hotels
together at night.

69
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,200
- Separate rooms.
- Well, that goes without saying.

70
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,300
I'm gonna say it anyway.

71
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,800
Hey! Look at what
you're wearing again.

72
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
Pam, have you ever seen
a magician's assistant?

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,000
That's...

74
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
- this is a new cardigan.
- Kind of--

75
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Maybe you could
tie it around your waist

76
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Or lose the shirt
underneath or something.

77
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,500
- No.
- Oh--All right.

78
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,400
- Hey, kelly.
- Screw you.

79
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
Uh, excuse me.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,600
That is no way to address a superior.

81
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,700
Oh, yeah? Screw you, too.

82
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,600
What was that all about?

83
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,000
You forgot her birthday.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,300
It was yesterday.

85
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,300
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,200
You do it.

87
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,100
- Okay.
- I insist.

88
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,300
Basically after
phyllis blackmailed angela,

89
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
Michael asked them both to step down

90
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,700
From the party-Planning committee
'Cause there was too much drama.

91
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,800
- What he said was--
- Just--Easy.

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
There was a problem

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,900
with having one head Of
the party-Planning committee.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,800
She becomes too powerful,
So he appointed two heads.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
- I am a paper salesman.
- Party-Planning is literally

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,400
The stupidest thing

97
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,800
- i've ever done in my life.
- This is humiliating.

98
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,300
That's on my side.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
So this is fun.

100
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,100
My birthday was yesterday
and everybody forgot.

101
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:09,400
I got really dressed up and excited,
And no one said a word.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,800
There wasn't even a party.

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,700
I think sometimes people are
really mean To the hot, popular girl.

104
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,100
Can i turn on the radio?

105
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,900
No. I need silence or
sam kinison to prepare.

106
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,500
But then you fall asleep
And there's nothing for me to do.

107
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,100
Then listen to your ipod, pam.

108
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,400
- That's dangerous.
- Well, then--Hey.

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,100
You know what? Let's just talk.

110
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,400
That's okay. I can--I'm fine.

111
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
I'll just play a song in my head.

112
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,800
You nervous about seeing karen again,

113
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,000
Since she was the other woman?

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,700
Actually, you were the other woman, so.

115
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,800
No, that was a long time ago.

116
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,000
Is that why you're
wearing makeup today?

117
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,400
No. I'm not even wearing that much.

118
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,800
I hate the idea that
someone out there hates me.

119
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,900
I even hate thinking
that al-Qaeda hates me.

120
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,800
I think if they got to know me,
They wouldn't hate me.

121
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,800
But karen knows me
and she still hates me, so.

122
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,200
- Oh, this is a nice office.
- You don't have to lie.

123
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,700
Through here.

124
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:12,900
phyllis?

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,200
Who's that?

126
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,100
She's out of your league, andy.

127
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,900
For your information, I have been
with lots of beautiful women.

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,700
Sexually?

129
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,200
This conversation is over.

130
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,700
I am single now.

131
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,900
What we have here

132
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,600
Is the ultimate smackdown

133
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Between the nard-Dog And crippling
despair, loneliness, and depression.

134
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,200
I intend to win.

135
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,000
We just wanted to say we are very sorry.

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,300
Screw you guys. You're dead to me.

137
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,600
If you say "screw you" one more time--

138
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,700
Yeah, screw you, beefer.

139
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,700
- I don't forget your birthday.
- Guys, guys.

140
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,100
- I would never do that.
- Oh. Hey.

141
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,400
- Hey!
- Guys, guys.

142
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,200
We just want to make it up
to you. What can we do?

143
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,900
I guess my only wish

144
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,400
Would be that nothing so terrible Would
ever happen to anyone else ever again.

145
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Oh, god.

146
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,000
- Okay.
- In a way,

147
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
it's good that it happened to me
Because at least i can bear it.

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
What kind of cake
do you want, imbecile?

149
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Ice cream.

150
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
Okay, uh, point at the dunder mifflin.

151
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,700
Hello, rolando. How are you?

152

go out On a little friend date sometime.

155
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,600
Uh, you're late.

156
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,100
Everyone's waiting
in the conference room.

157
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,400
Karen will be right here
to take you over.

158

Okay.

176
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Let's just get
this over with, shall we?

177
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,500
Ten. Ten months?

1
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,100
Are you kidding?

2
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,600
Well, i'm not done yet.

3
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:32,900
Dwight.

4
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,700
This fits in the palm of my hand.

5
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,400
You haven't blown 'em up enough.

6
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,500
Why have you chosen
brown and gray balloons?

7
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,900
They match the carpet.

8
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,700
What is that?

9
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,200
<i>"It is your birthday," period.</i>
It's a statement of fact.

10
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,900
Not even an exclamation point?

11
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,300
This is more professional.

12
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,400
It's not like she discovered
a cure for cancer.

13
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,900
I can't believe how bad this looks.

14
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,600
Are you trying to hurt my feelings?

15
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Because if so, you are succeeding.

16
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,100
Fortunately, my feelings regenerate
At twice the speed of a normal man's.

17
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,000
Okay, good then.

18
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,500
Have you collected
the money from everyone?

19
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
- I am working on it.
- How much do you have?

20
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,800
$6.

21
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,300
That's how much
you and i contributed!

22
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,400
<i>- I--
- Damn it, jim!</i>

23
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
I said i was working on it.

24
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,200
Trying to see what cds she's got.

25
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,600
It's good to know the deets
About the girl you're wooing.

26
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,900
Feist.

27
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,200
Yes!

28
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,800
No!

29
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh, my god.

30
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,700
Oh, no. That is so awful.
That is the worst news.

31
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,200
I have to go. I have to
do a presentation.

32
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,600
I'll talk to you--

33
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,500
This is going to be hard
for me to speak today

34
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,200
Because i just learned
that my father has died.

35
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,300
No, he didn't! He is alive.

36
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,100
And this isn't even a cell phone.
This is a calculator.

37
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,600
<i>But you bought it!</i>

38
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
And now you can't return it.

39
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,500
Or can you?

40
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,900
No, you can't.

41
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,400
<i>Yes.</i>

42
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,500
Karen, do you need to go pump?

43
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,100
Not gonna have to do that
Till after i have the baby.

44
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,800
No, i am wondering--
What are you talking about?

45
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,400
I am talking about How you
all need to sell an experience.

46
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,600
Like i sold you one--
The idea that my father had died.

47
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,700
But now we think you're a liar.

48
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,300
Would a liar bring mini mounds bars?

49
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
I am a theatrical person.

50
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
Growing up, i always thought
i would become an actor

51
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:45,200
Because i have These
memorization tricks that i use.

52
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,900
for instance,

53
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
I learned the pledge of allegiance

54
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,100
<i>By setting it to
the tune of old macdonald.</i>

55
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,900
* i pledge allegiance to the flag of *
* the united states of america *

56
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,100
* and to the republic for which *
* it stands one nation under god *

57
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,900
* with a woof-Woof here *
* and a woof-Woof there *

58
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,900
* here a woof, there a woof *
* everywhere a woof, woof *

59
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,000
Um, you get it.

60
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,700
I don't know you.

61
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
But i need to know you
in order to sell to you.

62
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,900
That is why i have asked you To
go around and tell me your names.

63
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,900
I have an amazing pneumonic device

64
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,900
By which i have now memorized
All of your names.

65
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,800
<i>Shirty. Mole.</i>

66
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,100
<i>Lazy eye. Mexico.</i>

67
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,100
<i>Baldy. Sugar boobs. Black woman.</i>

68
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,600
I have taken A unique
part of who you are,

69
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,700
And i have used that
to memorize your name.

70
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,400
Baldy. Your head is bald.

71
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,100
<i>It is hairless.</i> It is shiny.

72
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,400
It is reflective. Like a mirror.

73
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,100
"M." Your name is mark.

74
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,000
- Yes.
- Got it. It works.

75
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,500
- it's very insulting.
- But it works.

76
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,600
I would like you all to give
this a shot. What do you say?

77
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,500
But we already know
each others' names.

78
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,800
Well, then it will be easier for you.

79
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,300
But i--I still think it's worthwhile
To give it a-- Give it a try.

80
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,600
Okay. All right, everyone.
Meeting's over.

81
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Oh, i still have more.

82
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,300
Can i please see you
in my office, please?

83
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,000
She is pregnant. She is knocked up.

84
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,300
"K." Karen.

85
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,400
Pam, let's go.

86
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,900
I can't accept these prices, stanley.

87
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,100
- They just cut our budget.
- Brought you guys some coffees.

88
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,200
Stanley, i know you have
adult onset diabetes

89
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,600
So i put splenda in yours.

90
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,500
<i>Let's see. How many
did i put in there?</i>

91
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,300
<i>* one, two, three, four *</i>

92
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,500
* splendas in your coffee, stanley *

93
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,700
* none in yours, julia *

94
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,500
* 'cause i don't know how you take it *

95
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,100
* but if you'd rather... *

96
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,400
Four splenda. Are you crazy?

97
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,000
Well, no, i actually only put in two.

98
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,600
But that's not how the song goes.

99
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,100
- Are you out of your damn mind?
- <i>Are you out of your damn mind?</i>

100
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,400
You bring an angel
like that into this office

101
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,000
And you don't even
set me up with her.

102
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,000
We're not friends.
I didn't think about it.

103
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,800
<i>We are friends.</i>

104
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,500
Stanley, we're friends.

105
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,500
And you let me down.

106
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,200
You really like her, huh?

107
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,300
Yeah.

108
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,700
I really like her with all my heart.

109
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,600
Give me two clients for her.

110
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,300
I grab this,

111
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,400
And i turn it on and i say,

112
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,900
"Prepare yourself For the
utica chain store massacre!"

113
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,600
No, that's--That is
incredibly dangerous.

114
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,100
No, don't worry. The chain is off.

115
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
No, it's not.

116
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,100
You know, i think I'm just
gonna distill all of this

117
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
And send it in an email to my team.

118
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,600
Email's not scary. This is an
opportunity. Don't--Don't blow it.

119
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
So when are you due?

120
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,100
in about a month.

121
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
that is wonderful.
Congratulations.

122
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,300
Thank you.

123
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,300
It just all happened so fast.

124
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,200
It's really amazing.
Congratulations, karen.

125
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,100

126
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,600
So is there a guy or,

129
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,700
Yes, michael.

130
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,100
<i>- My husband impregnated me.
- Oh, great.</i>

131
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,800
His name is dan.

132
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800

133
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,000

134
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,400
Yeah, he's so cute.

135
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,000
He's a dermatologist.

136
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,100
We met at a bar. Can you believe that?

137
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,900
- What is happening there?
- Oh, yeah. don't even.

138
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,800
<i>That's really dorky.</i>

139
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,100
<i>it's really sweet.</i>

140
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
No, it's really dorky.
You were right the first time.

141
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,700
So how are things in scranton?

142
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,800
How's jim?

143
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,000
they're good. Uh, jim's good.

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,300
We're engaged.

145
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,700
That's so great. That's great.

146
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,800
Thank you.

147
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,500
Oh, my god. I'm so happy for you.

148
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,100
Thank you.

149
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Old hatreds dissolve
into new friendships.

150
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
It's a really wonderful moment.

151
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,600
I have to take care of
a couple of things,

152
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,900
So andy will be
taking over things here.

153
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,800
You're in good hands
And give my best to your mother.

154
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,800
So julia...

155
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,500
let's see.

156
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,700
With regards to, uh, billing,

157
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,300
Should we send bills to you
Or to your boyfriend's house or?

158
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,500
No, it could go straight
to our business address.

159
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,300
Oh, okay. All right.

160
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,400
That makes sense.

161
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,500
How does your boyfriend Deal
with your phenomenal success?

162
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,500
Is he just, like,
Totally threatened by you or?

163
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,400
Actually, i-- I don't have a boyfriend.

164
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,300
really?

165
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,100
Is that--

166
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,100
Wow, that's so weird.

167
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,500
Guys, stop everything.

168
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm about to ask out this girl
And i'm completely panicking.

169
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,900
oh, my desk is over...

170
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,700
This gal--

171
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,100
She's really into you?

172
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,300
Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,600
I mean, i've seen her,
like, three times today,

174
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,700
And we love all the same music,

175
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,800
And whenever i walk into a room
She totally looks up.

176
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,100
??say no more.

177
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,000
So. This is how i got squeaky fromme.

178
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,100
No small talk.

179
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,100
Just show her who's the boss.

180
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,800
Just go right in and kiss her.

181
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,500
Okay, it sounds risky.

182
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,100
Have i ever steered you wrong, jim?

183
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,000
Wait, what?

184
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
I would give that lecture a solid b+.

185
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,600
Although, for the record, karen--

186
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
Kind of mean.

187
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
- I like her.
- Really?

188
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
No, honestly.
Tell me what you really think.

189
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm serious.

190
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,700
i'm really glad i came.

191
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Why?

192
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,400
Because, um...

193
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,300
'Cause i'll never wonder ever again

194
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,400
If i did something wrong and--

195
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,700
Now i have closure.

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,200
She's happy and--

197
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't know, it feels good.

198
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,500
Thanks for walking me out.

199
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,700
Oh, my pleasure. Yeah, there's all
kinds of weirdoes out here, so.

200
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,000
- you must be freezing.
- I am about to die.

201
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,500
Will you wait here
while i go get my jacket?

202
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Oh, no, it's okay. This is my car.

203
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,100
Okay. Okay.

204
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,700
Well, listen.

205
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
You're a new client,

206
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,700
And as one of my new clients,
You will always be taken care of.

207
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,800
And that is the nard-Dog guarantee.

208
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,500
What's a "nard-Dog"?

209
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,200
This is the nard-Dog.

210
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
What the hell?

211
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

212
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,900
Oh, i--I thought we had this energy,

213
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
And i'm a mess,

214
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,400
And i just had my heart broken,

215
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,700
And you came in today
and you're so pretty.

216
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,800
- You're, like, incredibly pretty.
- I just got out of a relationship, too.

217
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,900
It's really hard.

218
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,200
Yeah--Right?!

219
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,300
Yeah. Do you want to talk about it?

220
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,500
Go to a mall or something,

221
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,300
- just walk around?
- No, i-- I don't think so.

00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,000
Sure, yeah. That's--You're right.

223
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,400
It's too soon.

224
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,600
