1
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:05,590
Dunder mifflin. This is pam.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,900
I'm sorry. He's not in yet.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,780
Would you like his voicemail?

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,330
Yeah!

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:15,440
Yeah,okay!

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,580
12 miles an hour.

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,500
Eat that,carl lewis!

8
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,780
Angela made
several 9-1-1 calls

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,390
About cars going too fast
in front of the building,

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,480
So the police put up a radar gun.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,260
It's actually caused a
bit of a traffic hazard.

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,350
Aah!

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,910
Wow,13!

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,400
No,no.No,there was wind.

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,450
I was just jogging.
Dwight,there was wind.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,210
- I want a do-Over.-
No,no,no. It's not your turn.

17
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,700
All right,13 is the new number.

18
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,740
Oscar,go ahead.

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,310
I want another try. Here we go!

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,840
31! 31!

21
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,900
There was a car.

22
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:57,160
I was ahead of the car.
31 is my new number.

23
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,630
31 is humanly impossible.

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,550
Go,oscar. 31's my numb.

25
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,620
- That's impossible.
- Beat it.

29
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,700
Today's a big day.

30
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,370
My presence has been requested by

31
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,840
Chief financial officer david wallace.

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,080
He says that he wants to
talk about big picture stuff.

33
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,340
And i'll be honest,

34
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:43,870
I have little or no idea
what that means,so...

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,040
Probably bad.

36
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,370
Quick announcement.

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,650
New year,new candy.

38
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,030
Whoo-Hoo!

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,070
Okay,be careful,kevin.
They're kind of spicy.

40
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,420
Hot tamales.

41
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,520
Yeah.

42
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,270
So maybe just try one at first,

43
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,730
And then if it's
okay,have a couple more.

44
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,240
Excuse me,everyone. Can
i have the floor please?

45
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,650
Um...

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,040
This is insanely awkward.

47
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:09,660
It's kind of the elephant in the room,

48
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,390
So i'll just...

49
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,480
No one has rsvp'd to our wedding yet,

50
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,900
And the deadline was yesterday.

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,720
Wait,you still
don't know--

52
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,410
No,no.

53
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,320
Nope.

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,050
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

55
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,330
- You still don't
- Why don't

56
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,340
- Let's
- What are you doing?

57
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,520
How about
we just--

58
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,450
I just have to talk to you for a second.

59
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,880
- Andy,has anyone
- Ahh!

60
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,920
No,no one has rsvp'd,

61
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,030
And i don't understand it.

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,690
And now you're shutting me out.

63
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,840
And you're not even listening.
And that's really considerate.

64
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,190
- Thank you.
- No,what i'm saying is

65
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,950
- No,no.No,that's not it.
- I know.

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,260
Andy still doesn't know

67
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,330
That angela's having
an affair with dwight.

68
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,210
And it's been 17 days.

69
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,880
I mean,eventually he'll figure it out...

70
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,300
When their kids have giant heads

71
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,470
And beet-Stained teeth.

72
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,430
But right now it's just...awkward.

73
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,710
How can he still not know?

74
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,820
- We can't figure that out.
- I can't take it anymore.

75
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,510
Wait,what? You can't take what?

76
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,560
I am telling andy.

77
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:04,650
No.You n't do that. It
shouldn't come from you.

78
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,920
Who should it come from then?

79
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:06,850
Angela. Angela.

80
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,860
From angela.Angela.

81
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,610
Are you still having
intercourse with her?

82
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,970
What is wrong with you? She is engaged.

83
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,030
Did you ever have
intercourse in this office?

84
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,690
Are you serious?

85
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,760
Ugh. Where?

86
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,220
Where?

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,200
Where,dwight?

88
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,760
Seems like you already know where.

89
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,640
Kevin,you screwed this form up again.

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,010
The amount owed goes at the top.

91
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,890
Oh,i'm sorry.

92
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,460
I didn't realize i was
doing something wrong.

93
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,350
If i had,i would've admitted it

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,060
And stopped right away.

95
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,100
That's enough.

96
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:57,220
Because i wouldn't
want an innocent person

97
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:00,980
Who doesn't know
anything about the form--

98
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,130
What?

99
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,220
That was good.

100
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,940
It jt at the end,you
weren't saying something

101
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,140
That could also apply to the form.

102
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,760
How about "i'm sorry i
did such a whorish job

103
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:16,040
Filling out this form."

104
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,470
There you go.

105
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,520
That cannot be true!

106
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,970
You're going to charge me a e

107
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,350
To cut my own cake?

108
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,270
Uh,no. No,no,no.

109
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,860
What i'm saying is i
want to cut it myself.

110
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,950
- Trade seats with me.
- No.

111
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
I've got a better angle on pam.

112
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:36,420
I can see everything.

113
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,590
Please stop.

114
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,600
I need a soup spoon.

115
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,010
Rule 17.

116
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,510
Don't turn your back on bears,

117
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,660
Men you have wronged,

118
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,030
Or the dominant turkey
during mating season.

119
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
There are 40 rules all
schrute boys must learn

120
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,800
Before the age of five.

121
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,550
Learn your rules

122
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,500
You better learn your rules

123
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,920
If you don't

124
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,230
You'll be eaten in your sleep

125
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,630
What is it?

126
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,220
You've got to tell andy about us.

127
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,810
That is a terrible idea.

128
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,200
- One of your worst.
- Get it over with.

129
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,800
Then we don't have to hide anymore.

130
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:26,440
You're expanding on your worst idea.

131
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,930
Do you love me or not?

132
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,980
I've already admitted that i do.

133
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,930
Why do you keep making me repeat it?

134
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,130
Because you're engaged to andy.

135
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,530
Well?

136
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,000
- Not yet.
- When?

137
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,700
When what?

138
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,150
When what?

139
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:56,510
You know this can't go on.

140
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,670
- What can't go on?
- We have to put an end to this.

141
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,140
- Seems like
- Come on.

142
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,180
You guys should...

143
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:06,770
Be hearing what i'm saying.

144
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,700
This is really not how
this is supposed to happen.

145
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,940
Angela said she was gonna tell him.

146
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,180
She's just not ready.

147
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,050
- When will she be ready?
- I don't know.

148
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,360
- Is she crazy in bed?
- Yes.

149
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,430
- Stop.
- How so,specifically?

150
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,750
What? Okay,listen.

151
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,480
- This shouldn't happen at work.
- Eager and flexible.

152
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,160
- And...
- Really?

153
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,670
This shouldn't be coming from his boss.

154
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,240
And we should also consider the fact

155
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,920
That that man has an anger issue.

156
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:25,990
Too late.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,220
Well,it's not too late,'cause
you haven't done anything.

158
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,380
I am already walking.

159
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,790
Michael,once this gets out,

160
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,040
I don't know how it's gonna go down.

161
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,840
Okay,what does that mean?

162
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,780
Might get ugly.

163
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,130
Jim,this has to get out

164
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,240
So we can all deal with it.

165
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,280
But you're leaving.

166
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,970
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

167
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,850
- Andy.
- Yeah?

168
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,310
Walk with me.

169
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:54,210
Will do,boss man.

170
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,860
Oh,i do not have much time.

171
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,830
Car's all the way over there.

172
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,260
To tell you what i have to tell you.

173
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,440
And just bear in
mind that when i say--

174
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,350
Say these things...

175
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,750
That are bad things that you hear...

176
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,160
In your ears,

177
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,290
This is something that i...

178
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,970
If i were you,that i
wouldn't want to hear.

179
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,140
You're not making any sense.

180
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,310
Well...

181
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,420
No,i'm not.

182
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,650
So i-- I'm not very
articulate today,

183
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,000
So i'll just leave it for another time.

184
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,030
- Another day.
- All righty.

185
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,190
- Which'll be
- Fine. I'm off.

186
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,090
- Have a good meeting.
- Thank you.

187
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,950
Kick wallace's ass.

188
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,450
Okay,i will.

189
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,930
Dwight and angela are
having an affair,so.

190
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,460
I can't hear you through the glass.

191
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,430
Dwight and angela are having an affair.

192
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,210
They've been sleeping
together for some time.

193
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,820
That was the news.

194
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,130
I wanted to let you know.

195
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,450
What? All right.See you later.

196
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,950
- Are you serious?
- Yep.

197
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,300
I knew something bad
was gonna happen today.

198
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,440
You said that yesterday.

199
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,470
Yeah,my neighbor got murdered.

200
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,660
What are you standing for?

201
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,680
If i'm sitting,

202
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,900
I can't disable his neck or his groin.

203
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,670
You're not gonna do anything
to his neck or his groin.

204
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,200
If i'm sitting,i don't
have the option to.

205
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,740
Dwight,i'm in charge
when michael's gone,

206
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,450
And i need
you to sit--

207
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,290
I need to talk to you.

208
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,740
We can talk right here.

209
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,040
I need to talk to you in private.

210
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,150
We're not listening.

211
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,620
Let's go to the conference room.

212
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,370
Is it true?

213
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,510
What have you heard?

214
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,020
That you're sleeping with dwight.

215
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,520
That doesn't sound like me.

216
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,560
Is it true?

217
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,520
Andy,i'm engaged to you.

218
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:34,440
I mean we just signed off
on our wedding flowers.

219
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,070
Would i have said yes
to formal chrysanthemums

220
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
If i didn't want to get married?

221
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,890
And we went through all that
stuff with our wedding cake--

222
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,000
Just answer the question.

223
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:44,370
Are you sleeping with dwight?

224
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:47,020
A little bit.

225
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,510
How long has it been going on?

226
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,590
I don't know.

227
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,250
I mean,we were together,

228
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,670
And then he killed sprinkles.

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,710
And then we stopped,and...

230
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,580
I don't know exactly
when we started up again.

231
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,000
Who else knows about it?

232
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,560
- Michael.
- Who else?

233
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,130
Let me think about it.

234
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,270
Oh,god.

235
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,270
Come on!

236
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,090
So listen,michael.

237
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,610
Your branch has been doing great lately,

238
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,730
D ur sales staff is reporting

239
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,360
Very strong numbers.

240
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,720
Outperforming last year,in fact.

241
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,120
Um,and i don't know

242
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:28,740
Exactly how to put this,

243
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,020
But...

244
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:35,150
What are you doing right?

245
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,050
- Right what?
- Utica,albany

246
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,390
All the other branches are struggling.

247
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,670
But your branch is
reporting strong numbers.

248
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,490
Look,you're not our
most traditional guy,

249
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,550
But clearly something
you are doing...is right.

250
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,690
Ani just-- I need to get
a sense of what that is.

251
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:55,620
David,here it is.

252
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,900
My philosophy is basically this.

253
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,690
And this is something that i live by.

254
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,550
And i always have,and i always will.

255
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,310
Don't ever for any reason

256
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,190
Do anything to anyone

257
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,220
For any reason ever,no matter what.

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,310
No matter
wh--

259
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,340
Where,or who,or who you are with,

260
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,700
Or-- Or where
you are going,

261
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:27,820
Or-- Or where
you've been...

262
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,380
Ever...

263
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,490
For any reason whatsoever.

264
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,960
Sometimes i'll start a sentence,

265
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,410
And i don't even know where it's going.

266
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:39,090
I just hope i find it along the way.

267
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,440
Like an improv conversation.

268
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,760
An improversation.

269
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,220
This is gonna sound
sort of high maintenance,

270
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:47,640
But could we have it,like,three
degrees cooler in here?

271
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,330
I always think better when it's cooler.

272
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,080
Here's the thing.Michael
is doing something right.

273
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,160
And in this economic climate,

274
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,490
No method of success can be ignored.

275
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,110
It's not really a time for executives

276
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,020
To start getting judgmental now.

277
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,510
It's hail mary time.

278
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,590
Hey,

279
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,410
What say we order up some pasta?

280
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,660
What say we do.

281
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,510
Standard,you know? Nothing fancy.

282
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,820
So,like,missionary?

283
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,810
I said nothing fancy.

284
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,260
Do you love him?

285
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,980
I love you.

286
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,500
Why should i believe that?

287
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,570
Andy,we are at a crossroads here.

288
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,750
And we can either give in
to what people are saying,

289
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,080
That we're not
good together--

290
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,140
Who says that?

291
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,330
Orwe can prove them wrong.

292
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,940
Let's prove them wrong.

293
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,030
Where's dwight?

294
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,410
- You okay,man?
- No.

295
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,500
Not at all,actually.

296
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,260
But thanks for asking. Appreciate it.

297
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,020
You know what?I'd also like
to take this opportunity

298
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,120
To thank all of you for lying

299
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,930
To my face.

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,080
And not telling me what's
been going on this entire time.

301
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:01,070
You are welcome.

302
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:08,540
Dwight.

303
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,400
Andy.

304
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,430
It's over.

305
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,290
Oh,good. She broke up with you.

306
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,660
No.

307
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,290
It's-- It's over
between you two.

308
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
Uh,no way.

309
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,770
I am not giving up.

310
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:24,190
- You have to.
- No,i don't.

311
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,290
She doesn't love you.

312
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,930
She's marrying me.

313
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,320
Well,i don't know about that

314
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,590
Because she certainly seems to enjoy

315
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,810
Making lovemaking with me.

316
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,580
Angelabernard.

317
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,960
Will never be her name.

318
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,450
It will be her name,

319
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,130
And you will have to call her that.

320
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,580
I don't think so.

321
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,610
Hey,guys,why don't we,uh,

322
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,640
Just cool off a bit?

323
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,900
I'm telling you to back down.

324
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,490
And i'm telling you that
i will never back down.

325
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,980
- Then i'll make you.
- Oh,really?

326
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,170
How are you gonna do that?

327
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,590
Through the use of force.

328
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,980
That is very general

329
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,470
And does not scare me in the slightest.

330
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,400
- I will fight you.
- Nope.

331
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:00,320
Okay,fine! Good!A duel.

332
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,140
The winner gets angela.

333
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,140
- Fine!
- Fine!

334
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,920
- This is nuts.
- What is your weapon?

335
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,430
Okay,you know what,that's
enough because--

336
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,730
Hey,this is none of your business.

337
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,130
Hey,it is my business
when it happens wk.

338
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,390
Guess what,

339
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,770
- Not happening at work.
- Yes.

340
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,470
- We're gonna do it outside.
- Outside of work.

341
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,050
- None of your business.
- None of your business then.

342
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,740
Good. So what weapon?

343
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,420
- My bare hands.
- That is stupid.

344
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,620
I will use a sword,and i
will cut off your bare hands.

345
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,050
Then i'll get something too.

346
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,830
I'vead two men fight over me before.

347
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,390
Usually it's over which one
gets to hold the camcorder.

348
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,900
Angela,you have to put
a stop to this right now.

349
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,280
I will respect the results of the duel.

350
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,120
- Of course you will.
- I call los.

351
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,780
I will be taking my break at 4:00

352
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:48,710
In the parking lot.

353
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,640
I will also be taking my break

354
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:54,250
At the exact same time
and in the same location.

355
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,610
What a coincidence.

356
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,990
So i either get more involved

357
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,630
Or i take a sick day...

358
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,340
Leaving dwight in charge.

359
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,340
Oh,god.

360
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,820
How'd that get there?

361
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,950
There's a star-Shaped thing
taped under the kitchen table.

362
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,940
Thanks,meredith.

363
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,440
So i was in the office,

364
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,860
And i look over to our
accounting division,

365
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,490
And there is kevin malone.

366
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,400
Kevin is wearing a jacket

367
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,250
That i've never seen before.

368
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,900
And i call over to kevin,

369
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,760
"Kevin,is that a tweed jacket?"

370
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,030
And he looks at me and he says,

371
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,400
"Michael,yes,it is a tweed jacket."

372
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,470
And i look back at him and i say,

373
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:04,170
"I feel the need...

374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,850
The need for tweed."

375
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,200
So.

376
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,080
It's hard to try and
evaluate yourself,michael,

377
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,770
But i appreciate you trying.

378
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,250
- And thanks for coming in.
- Oh,thank you.

379
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,050
Yes.

380
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,920
Have to say,i am so impressed

381
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,480
With the potential you see in me.

382
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,090
Yeah.

383
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,490
Yeah,finish up.

384
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,110
Come on!

385
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,810
Where are you?

386
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,380
Let's do this thing!

387
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,050
Come on! Come on out!

388
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,790
I can't believe they're
gonna fight over me.

389
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,020
I guess people have fewer
choices as they get older.

390
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,710
Come on!

391
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,670
Hey,has anything happened yet?

392
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,990
- Where are you?
- Mm. It's 4:10.

393
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,130
I don't think he's gonna show.

394
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,650
Oh,come on,man.

395
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,290
Believe in something.

396
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,550
Come on,coward!

397
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,310
Where are you?

398
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,920
Where--

399
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,290
What?

400
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,760
"From the desk of andrew bernard."

401
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,430
A note. Pathetic.

402
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,370
"Dear dwight,

403
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:21,910
"By now you have received my note.

404
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,590
"How are you? I am well.

405
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,450
"You are no doubt wondering
"why i have left this note.

406
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,680
"It's come to my attention "that
in any physical match with you,

407
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,230
I would surely be bested."

408
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,850
True.

409
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,840
"The soft underbelly of my refined
upbringing is my soft underbelly."

410
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:38,080
There's andy. He's in his car.

411
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,470
You guys,what is he doing?

412
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,110
Why isn't dwight turning around?

413
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,250
The prius is silent if he keeps
it under five miles per hour.

414
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,090
He deserves the win. Yeah.

415
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,620
"Alas,after much consideration
and deliberation-- "

416
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,080
Oh,my god!

417
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,960
What's happenin'?

418
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,590
Andy's running over dwight with his car.

419
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,940
Whoa-- What
are you--

420
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,640
- Hey! Hey!
- Yeah!

421
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,890
- Oh! Ho!
- Come on  ow!

422
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,440
Ah! Aah!

423
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,650
- You give up?
- Never!

424
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,570
Get out and face me like a man!

425
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,560
I am a man!

426
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:08,490
I'm a bigger man than you'll ever be!

427
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,760
I would never sleep with
another man's fiancee!

428
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,890
You're not a man!

429
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,080
You don't know how to take care of her!

430
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,730
All you do is dress fancy and sing!

431
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,660
La la la la la la la

432
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,690
What does that mean?

433
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,310
You can't even protect her!

434
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,400
Protect her from what?

435
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,900
Bears,you idiot?

436
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,180
When's the last time you
saw a damn bear in scranton?

437
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,230
Last year,idiot!

438
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,290
Dwight.

439
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,590
Are your legs broken?

440
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,830
No,my right one's falling
asleep a little bit.

441
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:33,600
Andy,are you all right?

442
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,900
Go away,tuna! I'm winning this.

443
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,940
Yeah,back off. This isn't your fight.

444
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,820
Oh,how ch is this gonna cost?

445
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,750
Oh!

446
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,720
What? Trust fund'll take care of that.

447
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,800
What did you say?I'm
sorry. I couldn't hear you.

448
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:47,310
I

449
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,470
What?You stupid idiot!

450
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,460
You're like a--You're
like a sasquatch.

451
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,160
- You live in the woods.
- Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet!

452
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,170
So fine,call me a sasquatch.

453
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,050
I don't get it.

454
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,880
How could she be sleeping
with you this whole time

455
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:02,670
And only sleep with me twice?

456
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,060
- What?
- What?

457
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,610
She's sleeping with you?

458
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,140
I'm her fiance.

459
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,390
She said she was only sleeping with me.

460
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,950

Wow,what a day! Ha ha!

00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,250
