1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,000
At least once a year, i like to bring in
Some of my kevin's famous chili.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,100
The trick is to undercook the onions.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,100
Everybody is going to
get to know each other in the pot.

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm serious about this stuff.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm up the night before pressing garlic
And dicing whole tomatoes.

6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,400
I toast my own ancho chilies.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,700
Jesus.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,200
It's a recipe passed down
from malones for generations.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,700
It's probably the thing i do best.

10
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,700
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,900
<font color="#ffff00">Sync:╧Бок</font>

12
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
the office S05 ep24

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Someone is returning!

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,300
He started his own company,
and now he's back.

15
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,400
Who could it be?

16
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,900
I'll give you a hint.

17
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,600
He is a man.

18
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,600
A man you have missed
with all your heart.

19
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,100
A man who has ruined
all other men for you.

20
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,300
Who is it?

21
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,700
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,800
It's michael scott.

23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,500
Hold it up.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,600
Conference room, five minutes.

25
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Well, i guess the first order of business
Is to welcome back me and pam and ryan.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,600
And how about casual friday again, huh?
Reinstituting casual friday?

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,400
You all look great.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,600
What i want to do right now
Is try something a little different.

29
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,800
I'm going to throw it out there,
starting with this meeting.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,200
I want you guys to run it.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,300
I want you to say whatever
you want, Take it away.

32
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,200
Your meeting.

33
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,200
Wh-What are you doing?

34
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,300
If there is something That
you would like to say as a group,

35
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,400
Then by all means,
you may say it to me right now.

36
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
Okay.

37
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,600
- Yes.
- People are dressed inappropriately.

38
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,300
Take it up with toby.

39
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:28,200
What i want you to do
Is i want you to look inward.

40
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,400
And i want you to reflect.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,300
And i want you to say something different.

42
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,500
Can you give us a hint?

43
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,400
When i needed salespeople
for my new paper company,

44
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,000
Everyone here turned their back on me.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,600
Am i going to ask them
to beg for forgiveness? No.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:49,800
Am i going to ask for
a big, crying apology? No.

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,500
Am i going to ask them to
slit their wrists for me? No.

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:57,500
I just want a tiny,
microscopic version of that.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,500
Oscar, what were you going to say?

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Nothing.

51
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
I didn't say anything.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,200
All right.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Do i still have a job here?

54
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,800
Not important.

55
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
Okay, all right.

56
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,500
- Yes. Yes, you have a job.
- ??

57
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,200
Frankly, you have a job because ryan and
pam Are starting with us as salesmen.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,700
- Wait, what?
- How is that going to work?

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,300
It's going to work very smoothly,

60
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,500
Because pam and ryan are
bringing over a ton of clients

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,000
From michael scott paper company and--

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
You mean the clients you stole from us.

63
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,300
Yeah, aren't we
getting those clients back?

64
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,100
No, you lost those clients.

65
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
- I call foul, sir.
- Okay.

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,300
You were bought out.

67
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,700
So the company then bought out
all of the stolen clients.

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,200
Okay, dwight, let me
explain something to you.

69
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
I set the rules and you follow them.

70
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,300
Blindly. Okay?

71
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,100
And if you have a problem with that,

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,000
Then you can talk to
our complaint department.

73
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,100
It's a trash can.

74
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,100
Don't fall in love with me, kid.

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,700
Boscov's at the steamtown mall?

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,400
It sure looked good on the mannequin.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,800
- Well, you have good taste.
- Well, thanks.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,700
I sure wish i had more time
to talk to my clients, though.

79
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:16,800
What?

80
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,000
Isn't that what you said
to a bunch of my clients

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,100
When you were stealing them?

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,700
That i didn't have enough time for them?

83
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh, i, um...

84
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Close your mouth, sweetie,
you look like a trout.

85
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,300
The man is wearing sandals.

86
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,500
I don't need to see oscar's toes at work.

87
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,700
Gross! I mean he looks like
he just got off the boat!

88
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,700
Can't you just not look at his feet?

89
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,300
Excuse me?

90
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,800
You're so educated, aren't you, toby?

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,500
So trained to deal with
a hysterical woman.

92
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,200
I don't want to look at his feet.

93
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
Do your job!

94
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,500
Well, i was in the seminary
for a year And dropped out

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,200
'Cause i wanted to have sex
with this girl, cathy.

96
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
??Followed her to scranton.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,900
Took the first job i could find in h.R.

98
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Later she divorced me.

99
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So no, i wouldn't say
i have a passion for h.R.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,600
- There you are, my friend.
- Oh, thanks, man.

101
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,100
Pamela.

102
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,600
- Thanks, michael.
- Yep.

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Fresh hot ink.

104
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,100
"New file system."

105
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,000
Trust me, stanley, You're going to
want to read this memo very carefully.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,900
??I am not changing the way
i do my files.

107
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,400
No. No. This goes for all of you.

108
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,700
Believe me, You are going
to want to heat my words.

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,900
When held over heat,

110
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,500
The invisible ink will reveal

111
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,600
That everyone should meet
at the warehouse immediately.

112
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,100
Do not ask me where
i got the invisible ink.

113
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,200
Urine. It was urine.

114
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,300
I'm sorry you're offended by my shoes,

115
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,900
But i'm not going to
drive home to change.

116
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,100
- I could loan you a pair of socks.
- No.

117
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:07,700
No, they're clean.

118
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,900
I was going to wear them
to volleyball practice later.

119
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,200
I don't think so.

120
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,200
Andrew bernard.

121
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay, what are you still
doing at your desk?

122
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,100
What are you still doing not at your desk?

123
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,400
Did you even read the memo?

124
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,700
All my files are now
in reverse alphabetical order--

125
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,400
No, you idiot.

126
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,000
There is a code embedded in the memo.

127
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Listen, you need to
round up all the salesmen,

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,400
Except for ryan and pam,

129
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,000
And get them down
to the warehouse pronto.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,700
Oh, it is on like a prawn
who yawns at dawn.

131
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,600
Stop doing rhyming poetry.
Just tell them, please.

132
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
God, the simplest thing.

133
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,500
We're in crisis mode here,
do you understand?

134
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,900
The two unqualified so-Called
salespeople Are being favored

135
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
Because they all failed together.

136
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
And frankly, i'm not convinced that

137
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
michael and pam Didn't have
a thing going while they were gone.

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,100
Can i address that?

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,300
- No, you're too close.
- Okay.

140
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,700
Stanley, how do you feel About
those two taking your clients?

141
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,700
It's not right. I don't like it.

142
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,100
He doesn't like it.

143
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,300
You don't take my clients away
And give them to a secretary.

144
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,800
No offense, jim.
I think she's very pretty.

145
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Her face is okay, but.

146
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,200
Jesus! What-- What are you doing here?

147
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't know. I saw a crowd.

148
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,100
I thought there might be a dogfight

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,200
- or something--
- Get out!

150
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,900
We need to do something.

151
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm thinking maybe a coup
or we take ryan hostage.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,400
- Those sound too harsh.
- No, i'm not saying we do those things.

153
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,600
I'm saying something like those things.

154
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,400
<i>- Of course.
- What is like a hostage?</i>

155
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,600
Excellent question.

156
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,800
We could write a strongly-Worded letter.

157
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
Words will never be enough.

158
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Strongly-Painted picture.

159
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,500
- No, pictures are too interpretive.
- Can i just say something?

160
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,100
I know that tempers are high,

161
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,200
But i think the best way to handle this
Might be to just talk to michael directly.

162
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,800
Well, that--

163
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,100
That's a great idea, jim.

164
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Oh, i totally see your point.

165
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,200
Okay, we'll talk to michael directly.

166
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
So uh, meeting is over, i guess.

167
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
- I'll see everyone upstairs.
- Great, see you upstairs.

168
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,600
Come on.

169
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Now is the time for action.
I'm talking action--

170
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,500
- That was great.
- I know.

171
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,900
- Why are you so mad?
- You look so classy in that picture.

172
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,200
I do? Well--

173
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,700
Where is that bowl?

174
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
- Hey, you have a second?
- Michael scott paper company only.

175
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,500
Yeah, i think you're gonna
want to cool it with that,

176
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,400
'Cause it's starting to
upset the other salesmen.

177
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,700
- Okay, well...
- tough.

178
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,500
I will-- No, no.

179
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,500
I'll talk to them when they
all get back from the bathroom.

180
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,700
This is awkward to talk about

181
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,000
But there may or may not be--
But definitely is--

182
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,900
A mutiny forming
in the warehouse right now.

183
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,700
- Against who?
- You.

184
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,800
- Us.
- What?

185
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
It's gotta be because
they all want their clients.

186
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,900
The old michael scott might have taken
this, But not the new michael scott.

187
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:44,400
They are in for a bitter surprise.

188
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,300
I am not to be truffled with.

189
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,500
Six weeks ago, None of these
people wanted to come with me.

190
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,000
You two were the only ones
with the stones to follow.

191
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,500
That was us, right there.

192
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,800
We were something else.

193
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,100
What you gotta do Is you gotta
go down to that warehouse

194
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,000
And you gotta crack some skulls.

195
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,800
Chiklis style.

196
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,000
<i>Yeah, the commish.</i>

197
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
<i>Yes, but chiklis shield style.</i>

198
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,500
<i>- Okay.
- Not commish style.</i>

199
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>Yeah, yeah. The shield.</i>

200
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,900
It's crazy what's going on
out there today, huh?

201
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,000
I know. Yeah, it's... kinda--

202
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,900
Sometimes it's best just to stay out of it.

203
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
That's true. That's right. Yeah.

204
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Want to play a game?

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,900
Hey, gang. Where you been?

206
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Lunch.

207
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,900
- Where'd you eat?
- A restaurant.

208
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,300
What'd you have, stanley?

209
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,900
I had a salmon salad.

210
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,400
With water, no ice.

211
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,800
I was going to get a soda,
But the waitress talked me out of it.

212
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,500
Her name was flo, she had black hair.

213
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,600
I had mexican food.

214
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,800
So since you guys already ate,

215
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,100
You won't be eating the stuff That
you brought with you for lunch, will you?

216
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,400
stanley.

217
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Is that egg salad?

218
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,300
- Andy brought some salmon.
- That looks great.

219
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,000
Dwight, is that a meat sandwich?

220
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,300
You guys hungry?

221
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,100
I can eat.

222
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm going to have
some of this meat sandwich.

223
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
It's pony.

224
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,500
What kind of sauce is on your salmon?

225
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
Dijonnaise.

226
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,600
Thanks for going out, guys.

227
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Hey, meredith, can i talk
to you privately for a second?

228
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,300
About what?

229
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,400
Your outfit.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,900
What? What's wrong with my outfit?

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
You-- You might consider
pulling it down a touch.

232
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,300
It's ri-- It's riding up a little high.

233
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,900
A bunch of prudes.

234
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,400
You know, oscar's
allowed to wear sandals,

235
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,300
But i'm not allowed
to wear open-Toed shoes?

236
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,500
Is that how it goes?

237
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,300
Meredith, your boob is out.

238
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,100
Fine.

239
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
No! Meredith, too far!

240
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,200
Damn it, meredith,
where are your panties?

241
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
It's casual day.

242
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,100
Happy?

243
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Toby! Toby, toby!

244
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,400
Toby.

245
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
No. If you do that, i'm gonna do that.

246
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
If you do that, i'm gonna do that.

247
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,500
If you do this, i'm going to do that.

248
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Well, what if i just do this?

249
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,600
You don't want to do that.

250
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,200
I'm just hiding out
until all this stuff blows over.

251
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,400
With creed.

252
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,200
Playing chess. At work.

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,500
He's winning.

254
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,400
I feel like i'm describing a dream i had.

255
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,500
I'm sorry you feel that way, mr. Bart.

256
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,100
Is there anything i can do
to make things better?

257
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,900
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,600
- Exactly.
- ??That's my client.

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,600
- This is your first complaint in ten years.

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600

263
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,600

264
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,000
- Give me the phone.
- You're not gonna find this anywhere else.

265
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,500
- Dwight schrute here. Hey, don't hang up.
- No, no, no. Sir, don't listen.

266
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
I know times are tough right now,
And i laud your thriftiness.

267
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,700
- Ryan, hand the phone over.
- Ryan!

268
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,200
Stop flustering me, everybody!

269
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,800
Who let this boy on the phone?

270
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,200
Mr. Bart!

271
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,100
I cannot believe you lost that account.

272
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,100
He was my client for ten years!

273
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,500
You made him lose the account
By screaming at him the entire time.

274
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,800
It's okay, ryan.

275
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,200
You're a secretary! What do you know?

276
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
- Okay.
- And you're a temp.

277
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,500
And i'm taking your phone.

278
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,400
- I'm confiscating this.
- Hey, hey, guys.

279
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,500
You know what i want you to do?

280
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Shake hands, get over it.

281
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,100
That was not a shake, dwight.

282
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,400
We want our clients back
or we quit, michael.

283
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,800
Who quits?

284
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Me.

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
And me.

286
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,100
Me too.

287
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,100
You guys gotta be kidding.

288
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,500
No, we gotta be deadly serious.
We'll start our own paper company.

289
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,100
The schrute-Bernard- Lapin-Vance...

290
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Stanley paper company.

291
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,600
I love it.

292
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,200
I love this idea, and i fully support you.

293
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,600
As a matter of fact, i'm
going to give you some seed money.

294
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,100
There you go. There's
some seed money for you.

295
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,900
And you can take it, no hard feelings.

296
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,700
But if you stay, i want an apology,
And i want a big one.

297
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,200
- You want us to apologize to you?
- Yes, i do.

298
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,900
That's completely backwards.

299
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,000
It's frontwards.

300
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Michael, you thought
you were attacking corporate,

301
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,600
But we were the ones who got hurt.

302
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,400
You should be apologizing to us.

303
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,100
- That's right.
- Right.

304
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Michael, you always said we were a family.

305
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,200
Then you went after us.

306
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,100
No matter how i look at this,
i am in the wrong.

307
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,400
And i have looked at this thing,
Like, a hundred different ways.

308
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,800
From my point of view,

309
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,800
From their point of view...

310
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,400
98 others.

311
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,800
And the bottom line, i am in the wrong.

312
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
I'm the bad guy.

313
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,200
I need you to arrange a meeting
Between me and the sales staff

314
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,800
Without ryan and pam knowing.

315
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,600
Gasp.

316
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,900
Are you talking about a secret meeting?

317
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,800
Whatever you guys did earlier.

318
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,000
I don't know the first thing
about secret meetings.

319
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,600
- Just do it, okay?
- I'll do--

320
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,000
- Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
- I'll do the best i can.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Are you kidding me?

322
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,400
- Deceit does not come easy to me.
- Okay, okay, okay.

323
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I really love your outfit.

324
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,500
Thank you so much for saying that.

325
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,800
I can't believe that
toby thinks this is inappropriate.

326
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,100
You look like j-Lo.

327
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,600
So from the bottom of my heart
To the top of my heart, i am sorry.

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,300
Are you giving us our clients back?

329
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,700
If we could just
focus and go down the line,

330
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,400
And everyone would say,
"apology accepted,"

331
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
I think we would all feel better.

332
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,800
And then we can
break out my gift to you--

333
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Complimentary white chocolate bark.

334
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,200
Nobody likes that stuff except for you.

335
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
They wouldn't make it
unless people liked it.

336
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,800
Michael, just give us our clients back.
That's all we care about.

337
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,700
Okay. If i give you your clients back

338
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,900
There won't be enough
clients for pam and ryan,

339
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,100
And i promised both of them
that they were gonna be salespeople.

340
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,400
- So?
- Fine, have your clients.

341
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,100
I can see that's what
you wanted all along.

342
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,100
Okay.

343
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,800
However, i rescind my apology.

344
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,900
- Okay.
- That's fair.

345
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,500
You are not reacting at all as i had hoped.

346
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,700
What'd i tell you about
building forts in my warehouse?

347
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,900
Michael gave all of our clients
Back to their old salespeople,

348
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,200
So now there's not enough
for both me and pam to stay on.

349
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,500
He can only keep one of us
as a salesperson now.

350
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,300
He'll make his decision
by the end of the day.

351
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,400
I think you should get it.

352
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,600
You really grew into it.

353
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
I think you should get it.

354
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,900
You've changed a lot
And you'd be good at it.

355
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,400
If you really think that,
will you tell that to michael?

356
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,200
That would go a long way
coming from you.

357
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,000
Yeah.

358
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,200
Thanks.

359
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,000
So hey, I want to
set you up with my daughter.

360
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,600
Oh, i'm engaged to pam.

361
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,700
I thought you were gay.

362
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,000
Then why would you want to
set me up with your daughter?

363
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know.

364
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,100
Jim. Can i talk to you for a minute?

365
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,600
Sure, let me just finish this turn.

366
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:06,000
And bingo was his name.

367
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,800
Let's go.

368
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Challenge.

369
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,400
I need your help.

370
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,900
This whole pam/ryan debate
is screwing with my head.

371
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,400
I don't want to be biased,
but i am very close to ryan.

372
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
- You know that.
- You're close with pam too.

373
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
- she's nice, i guess.
- You know what?

374
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,200
Best thing to do, pros and cons list.

375
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Pro for ryan, he went to business school.

376
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,100
He's my number one choice.

377
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,600
- Well, that's--
- I like his hair.

378
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,100
Cons, ryan.

379
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,700
He defrauded the company.

380
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,600
- He has never made a sale.
- Okay.

381
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,300
- He definitely stole my ipod.
- That sounds pretty biased.

382
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,500
You didn't hear my pros.

383
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
Environmentally-Conscious

384
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,300
'Cause his mom drives him
to work every day.

385
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,200
Okay.

386
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,000
Pam, pros. I like her.

387
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,900
I think that she is a fast learner.

388
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,200
Cons, she doesn't always follow through.

389
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,600
Sh-- New york and the whole
art school thing. And roy.

390
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,000
She has a weird voice.

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,200
- That's not true.
- I don't need to tell you that.

392
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,000
I think she'd be
a really good salesperson.

393
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,900
I don't think you are
being totally impartial, though,

394
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,900
Because you haven't said
one bad thing about pam.

395
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,400
- And i won't.
- Okay.

396
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
So be it, then you've lost credibility.

397
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,600
And i'm going to go
with my gut, and that's ryan.

398
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,200
??

399
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
You're right, sometimes
when she is tired,

400
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,900
She can be a little bit shrill.

401
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,400
But that's not a weird voice.

402
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,600
Take it easy.

403
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,100
man!

404
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,300
Honey!

405
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,300
I want you to bring the garbage out.

406
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
'Cause i'm not going
to have sex with you

407
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,500
Unless you bring out the garba--

408
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,900
I have a very difficult decision to make.

409
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,400
It's like last week
i was at the video store.

410
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,100
<i>Do i rent devil wears prada again?</i>

411
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,300
<i>Or do i finally get around
to seeing sophie's choice?</i>

412
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,900
It is what you would call
a classic difficult decision.

413
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,400
You don't understand clothing, toby.

414
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,100
You're dressed like
this amorphous blob of khaki.

415
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,900
All right, look, what you gotta understand
Is when you come to work,

416
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,700
you give up certain rights.

417
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,500
Listen up, flenderson.
You're being weak and ineffectual.

418
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,600
I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?

419
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,300
Here are the new rules.
Okay, earth tones only.

420
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,700
Also, women are forbidden
to wear pants.

421
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,300
All right, come on. Sit down, dwight.

422
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,600
- No.
- I'm running this meeting.

423
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
- That's debatable.
- It's not.

424
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,600
??It's not. Sit down or i'm writing you up.

425
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,200
where has this guy been?

426
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,800
Casual fridays are cancelled.

427
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,200
Let's just not do it anymore.

428
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,300
- No, it is a solution.
- You're running from the problem.

429
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,600
There's not a single appropriate
outfit In this whole--

430
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,500
Except mine, quite honestly.

431
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Pam, can you come in here, please?

432
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Have a seat.

433
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,300
??

434
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,200
Well, there's no easy way of saying this.

435
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,100
So i think i will just...

436
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
drag it out.

437
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
- Since the dawn of time there has been--
- Just tell me.

438
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,400
I gave ryan the sales job.

439
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,800
There just weren't enough clients
for the two of you.

440
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,400
So i had to--

441
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,700
- No, okay.Okay, i get it. Yeah.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

442
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,400
Why are you giggling?

443
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,900
Is this a joke?

444
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,100
Michael, is this--

445
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,200
Did i get the job?

446
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
- Yes, you did.
- I did?

447
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,300
- Yep.
- For real, you're not kidding?

448
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,000
- No, you-- No.
- I did?!

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,500
No, you're the best person for the job.

450
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,000
- You're going to be great.
- Oh, michael, thank you. Thank you.

451
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,900
Thank you. You will not be sorry.

452
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,400
You should've seen your face.

453
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,900
Oh, man!

454
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,800
that was classic.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,200
I really thought i didn't get it.

456
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,700
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

457
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,800
- 'Cause you said i didn't.
- Oh, man. That was really good.

458
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,600
- That was really good.
- Oh, what about ryan?

459
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,200
I don't know, i offered
him his temp job back.

460
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,200
We'll see.

461
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,300
He was not happy at all
when i offered him this job,

462
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,400
And then i told him
he didn't get the job, so.

463
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,200
Yeah.

464
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Maybe you shouldn't
fake fire people anymore.

465
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,000
I don't appreciate
you telling me what to do.

466
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,300
So clean out your desk,
you are through here.

467
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
Thanks, michael.

468
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,700
What's our receptionist's name?

469
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,700
Erin.

470
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
Could you send her in?

471
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,400
Erin.

472
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
Michael wants to see you.

473
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,300
- Hello.
- Hi.

474
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,700
Have a seat.

475
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,500
This is very difficult to say,

476
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,900
But no one here likes you in the office
And we are going to have to let you go.

477
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
Hank, would you come up here, please?

478
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,800
Hank is our security guard.

479
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,000
- Oh, i can go.
- He will be ushering you out.

480
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
Oh, your face!

481
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,000
- Is-- Do the people--
- No, i'm kidding. No, you're not--

482
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,700
You're not fired. Yet.

483
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,100
Do they not like me, though?

484
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,000
- I don't know, actually.
- Okay.

485
