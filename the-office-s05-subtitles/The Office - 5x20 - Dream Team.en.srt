96
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,600
I am such an idiot.

Oh, he does.
He does.

102
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I feel weak today.

103
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,900
I felt much stronger
yesterday.

104
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,400
Like benjamin button

105
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,700

Something i like to do
is make a list.

00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,300
Make a list of things to do

110
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,100

- Check.
- Don't patronize me, pam.

117
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,800
I think you

118
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,200
I'm not getting dressed.

119
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,700
I'm not getting dressed. I have too
many things to do before i get dressed.

120
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,300
I need to find 100 clients.

121
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,800

122
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,000
It's totally impossible.

123
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,800
We need to come up With

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,300
one realistic thing
that we could do today.

125
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,900
Assemble a sales team.
A dream team.

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Great.

127
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,300
Okay, ryan.

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,500
No. What? Why?

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,300
He's everything i'm not,
and everything i am.

130
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
He's the whole package.

131
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,400
No, we're not gonna hire ryan.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,900
Um, oh, vikram!

133
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,800
Best salesman i've ever met.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,600
- Okay.
- He worked
at that telemarketing place.

135
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
- We'll find him.
- Okay.

136
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,100
Oh, also, we have a meeting this
afternoon With a potential investor.

137
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
- Really? We have
an investor already?
- yeah

138
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,500
Maybe. Barbara kevis.
She invests in local businesses.

139
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
And i'm putting together
a little presentation for her.

140
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,000
Michael, that's fantastic.

141
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,900
Yeah, i guess
it's not so bad.

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,700
Got a few things cooking.

143
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,000
- Um.
- Hey.

144
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,500
We need to get you dressed.

145
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,100
I have doubts about this too.

146
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,000
But when one person freaks out,

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sometimes it weird makes
the other one calmer.

148
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,100
That's one thing i've learned
about relationships.

149
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,100
I hate that i just used
the word relationship.

150
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,800
Hey.
You look great.

151
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,200
- Let's go.
- All right.

152
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,200
Ah.

You a soccer fan?

154
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,900
Oh. Oh, yeah.
I'm so embarrassed.

155
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,500
You weren't supposed to see this.
This is like my secret obsession.

156
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
Well, that makes two of us.

157
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,700
- No way.
- yeah

158
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,700
I hate soccer.

159
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,700
But guess
who doesn't hate soccer?

160
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,200
Charles minor.

161
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,400
I was actually in germany
for the 2006 world cup finals.

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,800
Oh. You bastard.

163
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,700
That should have been me.

164
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,700

I've never been a kiss-Up.

167
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,900
It's just not how i operate.

168
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,200
I mean, i've always
subscribed to the idea

169
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,200
That if you really want
to impress your boss,

170
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,900
You go in there
and you do mediocre work.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,600
Halfheartedly.

172
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,700

00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,700
"Of yourondominium agreement To conduct
a business headquartered "In your residence.

179
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,600
The penalty of forfeiture
of residence..."

180
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,500
No, okay.
It's fine. It's fine.

181
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,800
We're just gonna add,
"find office."

182
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
How are we gonna find
an office?

183
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,700
How can we pay
for an office?

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,800
??? Song parodies.

185
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,200
Okay, okay.
Achy breakfart.

186
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,300
Great. Let's sing it in the car.

187
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,100
No, no, no.
My stumps.

188
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,700
Likemy humps,
but a guy with no legs.

189
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
- Yeah.
- We can do this.

190
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,700
We can do this.

191
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,700
Whoa, and he just goes boom.

192
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,900
- Yeah. Score.
- That's pele.

193
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,600
You know your soccer, man.

194
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,300
I prefer maradona.

195
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,900
Diego maradona
from argentina.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,900
I didn't know we had so many
soccer fans in the office.

197
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,600
I mean, to be fair, i was the
first one To talk about it, but...

198
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
what about you, jim?
Are you a fan of the game?

199
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,600
Oh, no. No.
Not really.

200
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,300
Well, it's not for everybody,
i suppose.

201
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
That's 'cause i'm more
of a player.

202
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,900
- Yeah?
- Youet.
- Really, jim.

203
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,100
I had no idea
you played soccer.

204
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,700
'Cause you never,
ever talk about it.

205
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,600
- Well, i do. I play.
- Wow.

206
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,800
- You can be so modest sometimes.
- Maybe we should get back to work.

207
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,300
Maybe you and charles should
kick the soccer ball around.

208
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,300
Maybe we will someday.

209
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
Maybe you will tonight
after work. What do you say?

210
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,800
That's a great idea, dwight.

211
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,700
Great ideas are just part
of what i bring To the table.

212
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,700
I don't try and be anything
that i'm not.

213
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:06,000
What do you say, jim?
Huh? Wanna play some soccer?

214
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,200

00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,600
From second
to fourth grade.

221
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,000

223

- He can be.
- Confidence-- 

230
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:53,600

But the liquor of the fool.

With a lean, mean fighting crew

314
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,100
I thini can perform
the same business

315
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,000
At a much,
much higher rate of profit.

316
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,700

Come on, oscar.

325
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500

326
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,300
- Wing.
- Leg.

327
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,400

- Let's see what you got
in those legs. All right.
- All right, let's do it.

331
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,800
No, no, no.

332
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
No, there's supposed
to be the kickoff.

333
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,500
Kickoff.

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,500
My strategy is to touch
the ball as little as possible.

335
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,500
Chalk it up to teamwork.

336
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,500
All right.

337
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,200
And i offer same day,
free delivery.

338
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,100
Michael,
i don't know about this.

339
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Nana, 

340
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,200
i really think that papa
would want you To do this.

341
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,400
I'm not so sure.

342
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,300
Well, what ist exactly? What-- 

343
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,600
What specifically?
It doesn't have to be paper.

344
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
We could sell medicine
and other...

345
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,000
see, this is what concerns me.

346
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,500
We could just give him a chance.
It's not much money.

347
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,700
Well, this may not be
the right time,

348
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,500
But i need more
than i originally asked for.

349
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,500
It's ???? an investment club.

350
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,700
- Okay.
- I love you, michael. I do.

351
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,600
Okay.

352
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,900
But no.

353
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,600
I mean it. No.

354
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,900
I thought nana raised
some good questions.

355
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,200
What kind of a name
is nana?

356
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,200
It means grandmother.

357
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,200
Oh, sweet jesus.

358
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,700
Look, i'm sorry to do this, 

359
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,200
But can you drop me back
at the telemarketing building?

360
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,600
You know, michael,
you want to succeed?

361
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,200

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,700
No, i swallowed a crown.

368
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,200
Why'd you duck, jim?

369
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,700

scer player Like yourself 

370
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,200
duck at the very last moment?

371
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,300
Okay, i'm just gonna go get
some ice.

372
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,900
Does that make
you feel better? Huh?

373
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,700
- I-I'm sorry, phyllis.
- Oh, yeah, jim's sorry.

374
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Do you get tnt?
The station? Do you get tnt?

375
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
Yeah, i have cable
and satellite as a backup.

376
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,000
Yeah, i know, two not-So-Great
things in a row.

377
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,400
Well, well, stuff happens. Right?

378
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,900
At least we got ryan.

379
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,800
The ry-Guy.

380
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,800
We should call him ry-Bread.
We don't have to call him that.

381
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,900
Unless you like it.
We could call him that.

382
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,500
I can't do this.

383
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,400
What's that?

384
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,100
I can't do this.
I had a real job.

385
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,600
I sat ten feet away
from my fiance.

386
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,900
I had health benefits.

387
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,300
I was just feeling impulsive. I should
have gotten a tiny tattoo on my ankle.

388
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Yecch.

389
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,700
I just keep getting bored.

390
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,900
And i let things build up
and build up,

391
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
And then i do something
too big.

392
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,000
Like this.
Who does this?

393
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,600
Well, you know what? My mom
always used to say that average people

394
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,200
Are the most special people
in the world,

395
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
And that's why god made
so many--

396
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,000
We don't have any money.

397
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,900
We don't have an office.
We don't have anything.

398
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,300
Well, we should make a list.

399
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,100
Lists are good.
Lists are good. Lists are good.

400
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,500
First on the list, let's get
you out of the car. All right?

401
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,500
Okay.

402
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,100
How come out of everyone
in the office,

403
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,300
I'm the only one
who went with you?

404
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,200
Is it because i'm that stupid? I mean, your
own grandmother doesn't even believe in you.

405
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,200
I want you to listen to me.

406
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,300
Because i want to tell you

407
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,000
The situation that
we are both in right now. Okay?

408
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,100
You quit your job.
I quit my job.

409
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
We both quit.

410
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,600
Those are the facts.
That's what happened.

411
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Now what are our choices
right now? Because, 

412
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,000
you know what, kiddo?
You quit.

413
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,100
- Yeah.
- So what are our options? Well...

414
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,800
we can start this
paper company. We can try.

415
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,700
Or that's it.
That's o only option.

416
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,500
Because we quit.

417
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:17,900
Pam, i do my best work when
people don't believe in me.

418
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,100
I remember in high school,

419
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,700
My math teacher told me
i was gonna flunk out,

420
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,300
And know whai did?

421
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,300
The very next day,
i went out,

422
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,800
And i scored more goals than anyone
In the history of the hockey team.

423
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,900
See what i mean?
I thrive on this. I thrive on it.

424
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,900
So i'm gonna go inside.

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,900
I'm going to make
some calls.

426
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,800
I'm gonna get us an office space,
And i'm going to show you

427
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,700
Why you joined this company,
all right?

428
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,800
You gotta have some extra
space, billy. Work with me here.

429
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
There's gotta be 

430
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,400
some sort of secret office
That you have lurking around.

431
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,200
Something awesome and free.

432
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,500
And you keep it off the books.

433
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,500
Oh, no, not there.

434
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,700
That would be humiliating.

435
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
I did what i had to do.

436
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,600
I stepped in.
I took charge.

437
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,900
That's what being a man is.

438
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,900
And earlier today,

439
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:25,000
i was freaking out.
Pam stepped up. She was the man.

440
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,600
Don't think
a woman can be a man?

441
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, then that's
your stereotype. Not mine.

442
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
Okay.

443
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,200
I could work here.

444
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,800
I could see this.

445
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,300
It's right in the middle
of the pap belt.

446
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,700
Are you good?

447
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,200
Yeah, i'm good. You good?

448
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,100
I'm good.

449
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,400
You know what they say.

450
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,200
Keep your friends close.

451
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,100
Michael.

452
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
- You're back.
- Yes, i am, charles.

453
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,100
Except this time you have
no legal right to kick me out.

454
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:22,400
Because i have started my very own paper
company Right here in the building.

455
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,600
If i were you, charles minor,

456
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,200
I would watch your step.

457
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Because the michael
scott paper company 

458
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,300
is about to open A big old can
of whoop-Ass on dunder mifflin.

459
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,200
Actually, a six-Pack. We're gonna
open a six-Pack of whoop-Ass.

460
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,300
He looked scared.
