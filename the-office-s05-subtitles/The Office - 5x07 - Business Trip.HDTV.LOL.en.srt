1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,900
Did you know
that in Morocco

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,900
It is common to exchange a small gift

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,600
When meeting somebody
for the first time?

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,800
In Japan, you must always
commit suicide to avoid embarrassment.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,400
<i>In Italy,</i>

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,700
You must always wash your hands
after going to the bathroom.

7
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,900
This is considered
to be polite.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,200
Why are you
telling us this?

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:24,800
I am jetting off
on an international business trip.

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,700
Where you goin'?

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,500
To can-A-Da.

12
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,500
Where is it?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,600
- Canada.
- Okay.

14
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,900
My boss is
sending me abroad

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,800
To do a presentation
to an international client.

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
And I have always
been intrigued

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,900
By all things
international--

18
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,700
The women, the pancakes,

19
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,200
The man of mystery--

20
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,000
Meredith,I would like you to pretend
that you are from Abu Dhabi.

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,900
Hello.

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,700
I am ashamed
at your naked face.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I must cover it
with my jacket.

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,600
You are now sexy
in your culture.

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,500
- T-Minus...
- 6.5 days.

29
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,300
One more week.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Pam comes back
from New York next week

31
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,500
And everyone here has just been
so excited for me.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,000
And involved.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,600
And intrusive.

34
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,900
And weird.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,600
One more week!

36
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,400
Heh heh.

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Do you have your passport?

38
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,400
I have my passport.

39
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,300
Got your per diem?

40
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,200
I have my per diem.

41
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,100
I already know
what I am going to spend this on.

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,500
I'm going
to buy a sweater.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,500
Michael, the--
That's for your food.

44
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Well, I'll just--I'll
use different money for that.

45
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,600
I was happy to send Michael
on this trip.

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,400
He's been feeling
pretty down since

47
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,000
We had to transfer Holly
up to new Hampshire and--

48
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,200
But this little perk really
seemed to turn him around.

49
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,200
And it's pretty tough

50
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,500
To find somebody who wants
to go up to Winnipeg...

51
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Mid-November.

52
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,400
And business class Air,

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,500
Like a five-Star hotel
in the sky,

54
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,600
Nothin' but the best.

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,500
Actually, better than
a five-Star hotel

56
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
'Cause you get
a big, cushy seat

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,300
And you sit
in a row of people.

58
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,900
And to eat, whatever
the mind can imagine.

59
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,800
I think
I am going to have

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,500
A filet
with mushroom sauce.

61
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
<i>Well, I'm just
glad you're happy,</i>

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,200
<i>'Cause, you know,
I felt bad.</i>

63
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,100
<i>Well, that is
all in the past.</i>

64
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,300
<i>And in terms of nightlife,
when you get there,</i>

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,400
<i>Just ask the concierge.</i>

66
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,000
They have one of those?

67
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,100
*Let's do this*

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,600
Wait, why do you
need three suitcases?

69
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,400
Two are empty
for souvenirs.

70
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,700
- You have your money belt?
- I do.

71
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,400
- It is right here.
- No, no, no, no, no.

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,200
You want to wear that puppy right up
on the breastbone like a bra.

73
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,300
No,I don't want
to wear a bra.

74
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,200
Let me help you.

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Stop it.
Stop it!

76
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,400
Do you want to get robbed
in a foreign country?

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
I wash my hands of this.

78
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,100
Okay.
Where's my translator?

79
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,700
- Monsieur.
- There he is.

80
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,400
I'm just bidding
a bon voyage

81
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,000
A la mon petit fianc</i>

82
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Translation:Good-Bye,
my petite fianc

83
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Be good.

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,600
- I will try.
- Meaning what?

85
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,900
Meaning I will try
to get other dudes laid.

86
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,700
Yeah, baby!
That's what I'm talkin' about.

87
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,700
That could be you if you
hadn't forgotten french.

88
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,900
Where is my numbers man?

89
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,800
- Here.
- There we go!

90
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,100
Our town car awaits.

91
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,100
It's just a van.

92
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,400
It's not just a van.

93
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,200
Look,I know my way
around a van.

94
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,900
That is just a van.

95
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,300
Dwight, could you
get those, please?

96
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,200
Welcome to cribs--
Business class edition.

97
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,000
Check this out.
Mimosa.

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,600
- Ah, sweet!
- Handed it to me.

99
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
As i sat down.
This was my hot towel.

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,900
It is still wet.

101
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,200
Michael g. Scott,
rollin' like a pimp!

102
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,900
- Take a sip of that.
- Mm-Hmm!

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,300
- That good?
- Mmm.

104
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,400
- Don't drink all of it.
- Mmm!

105
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
<i>Os--Give some
to oscar.</i>

106
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,900
- That's really good.
- I'm good.

107
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,500
You want one of your own?
I can hook you up.

108
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,800
I'm sorry.
You'll need to keep moving.

109
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,100
Yes, this is Beth.

110
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,900
This is my personal valet
slash flight attendant,

111
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,900
And she will be
helping me this morning.

112
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,200
We need to keep
the aisle clear.

113
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,500
- Yes.
- Oh!

114
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,000
- Get back, get back.
- All right.

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,200
Come on!
Get back to the slums!

116
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

117
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
Hey, guys.
Check it out.

118
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:53,200
My own personal dvd player
and 20 movies.

119
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,600
Andy brought one,too.

120
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
- Harry and the hendersons.
- Shh!

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,100
Keep it down.

122
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,100
I made
egg salad sandwiches.

123
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,100
Do you want one?

124
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,600
Could you have picked something
stinkier to bring on a plane?

125
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,100
Oh, my god, oscar.

126
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,500
Really--Do you have a bag
of baby poop in there,too,

127
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,700
To share
with everybody?

128
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,400
No,I'll be
ordering my own food,

129
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Thank you very much.

130
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

131
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Um,I'd like
to see a menu, please.

132
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,600
Oh,I'm sorry,
there are no meals

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,300
On flights
less than two hours.

134
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
Oh, okay.

135
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,800
Doesn't matter,

136
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,200
Because I am going
to take a nap.

137
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,700
I think I'm going to use
my complimentary blindfold.

138
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,900
I will don it...

139
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,800
And--Oh!

140
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,300
Look at that.

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,900
I can't see
because I am in a--

142
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,600
Gah!

143
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,300
And what would you
like to drink?

144
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,900
Just checkin' out

145
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,600
Where I'm gonna be
pretty soon.

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,200
When pam gets back.

147
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,800
Gonna be close quarters.

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Gonna be
a lot of tension.

149
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,500
For you.
I'm with Darryl.

150
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,500
This looks like where

151
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,700
I'll probably do
my push-Ups every day.

152
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,400
Is that supposed
to impress me?

153
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,900
No.
Not gonna happen.

154
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,100
He has hurt me
too much and too often

155
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,200
And I am in a healthy
relationship now.

156
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,900
So i'm not gonna flaunt it,
I'm not gonna hurt him,

157
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,400
But that door is closed.

158
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
What are we doing?
This is so wrong.

159
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
- Yeah. Mmm.
- Mmm. Mmm.

160
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,200
This is nice!

161
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,000
This is nice.

162
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,700
Move in here.

163
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,200
Very sweet.

164
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,000
Ah!

165
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,800
- I'll check us in.
- All right.

166
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,400
- Very cool!
- Very cool.

167
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,300
We are gonna find out where
the action is,

168
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,200
Okay.
My friend.Where's the concierge?

169
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,500
Yes. Wallace said there
would be one of those.

170
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,100
Mmm, bingo.

171
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Follow moi,
bro-Sieur.

172
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,500
Wow!

173
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,500
What about
a nice sushi place?

174
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,200
Maybe a place
with a view?

175
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,700
Oh.

176
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Matsuki.
That's a good one.

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,900
Uh, you may walk there
if you wish

178
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,200
Or you may take the number 17 bus
until 9:00.

179
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,100
Other than that,
you can take the taxi

180
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,900
And the number
is right there.

181
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Wow! Wow.
I'm blown away by this.

182
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
I, um...
I--Ah!

183
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
This is great.
Thank you.

184
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,000
- One final question.
- Um.

185
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,700
Where might you find yourself
on a winnipeg night like tonight?

186
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,500
Oh, the huntsman is good.

187
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,100
- The huntsman.
- Down here.

188
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,000
 - The financial district.
- Mm-Hmm.

189
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
A concierge is the winnipeg
equivalent of a Geisha.

190
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,000
This is a woman
who has been trained

191
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,100
In the fine art
of fanciness and pleasure.

192
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,800
And when you meet one,
it is intoxicating.

193
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,800
Just what
the doctor ordered.

194
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,800
Can't believe this.

195
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,100
Are you sure?

196
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,700
<i>I just talked to my advisor.</i>

197
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,900
<i>Failing.</i>

198
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,400
Wow. I thought
you were good at flash.

199
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,600
I was,and then
they switched to acrobat

200
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Just as I
was learning quark.

201
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
I--I hate computers.

202
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Okay, okay.
It's no big deal.

203
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,600
So you're not
a computer geek.

204
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,700
I have to stay
and retake it.

205
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,700
W--

206
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,200
Wow. Um.

207
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Well...okay.

208
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,700
That means
another 12 weeks.

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,400
Can you do another
three months of this?

210
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,500
It's not--
It's not about me.

211
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,300
I mean,
this is your dream.

212
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,000
And you went to new york
to do this.

213
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,200
So when you come back,

214
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,500
You come back
the right way.

215
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,400
Right?

216
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,000
Right.

217
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,000
You okay?

218
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,600
Uh, my cell battery's low,

219
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
So I have to let you go.

220
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Okay.

221
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,700
<i>- All right.
- All right.</i>

222
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

223
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,900
Love you, too.

224
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
<i>Guys.</i>

225
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
She's sittin' there.

226
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,300
Engaging wings.

227
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,300
I'm probably gonna
leave after one drink.

228
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,600
- Let's do this.
- Yeah, with a hot slab of

229
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
canadian bacon in your hand.

230
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Excuse me.
Hello.

231
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,000
Concierge marie.
Michael scott.

232
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
- Good to see you again.
- Hello.

233
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,300
Good to see you.

234
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,600
Um, this is my associate,

235
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,200
Uh, from Dunder Mifflin.

236
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,600
Uh,Oscar Martinez.

237
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,400
- Nice to meet you.
- Oscar.

238
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,700
Works in accounting.

239
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
- This is,uh,Concierge Marie.
- Yes.

240
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,800
Who works at our hotel.

241
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:57,000
You look, how you say,
radiant tonight.

242
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you.

243
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
And it is, how you say,
a beautiful night--

244
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,300
Michael, why?

245
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,300
She's foreign.
I am--

246
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,700
<i>For madame et monsieur.</i>

247
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,400
Oh, thank you.

248
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,700
You're very welcome.

249
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,400
- Thank you, Andy.
- Thank you?

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,400
Let me get a picture
of you guys.

251
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,700
Everybody's going
to end up dying someday,

252
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,000
And I think
it's better to die

253
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,400
With some people
that you like--

254
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,900
Like Oscar, and Andy,
and Concierge Marie--

255
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,600
Than to know that
there's somebody out there

256
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
That you love
that you're not with.

257
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
All right.
I've scoped out the joint.

258
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,100
Those two dudes
are as good as naked.

259
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
How do you even
know they're gay?

260
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,300
Come on! It's Dandy Cale
and Foppy Mcgee over there.

261
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
Mademoiselle!

262
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,500
<i>Beer me dos long island
iced teas, s'il vous plait.</i>

263
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,600
Bad decision
in a glass.

264
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,500
I don't care
if you're gay, straight,

265
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,100
Engaged--Whatever.

266
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,800
A guy needs intercourse.

267
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
You will thank me
when they spank thee.

268
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:07,800
Don't do this.

269
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,300
- You guys like apples?
- What?

270
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,500
Do you like apples?

271
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
Uh, sorry, what--

272
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, how do you like
these apples?

273
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,200
All right, on a scale
of one to ten

274
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,400
How hot is that dude?

275
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,800
Is he your boyfriend
or something?

276
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,500
No, but he
could be yours

277
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
If you play
your cards right.

278
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,600
Dude. Leave us alone,
all right?

279
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,800
Gentlemen.

280
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,900
What are you doing?

281
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,100
Dude, you struck out.
They're totally stuck-Up.

282
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,200
Here, drink up.

283
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
How about this one,
it's Christmas Eve--

284
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Mm-Hmm.

285
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,000
And everything
is closed,

286
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,200
And you need to get
some dry cleaning done.

287
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
12:00 midnight.

288
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Where do you go?
What do you do?

289
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
What do you do?
Come on.

290
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,100
- What do you do?
- Uh...

291
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,400
Astro Cleaners on st. James place
is the only place that

292
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,200
- is open on that day.
- Unbelievable.Unbelievable!

293
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,800
If you don't
mind me asking--

294
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,600
Anything. You can
ask me anything.

295
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
- Okay.
- I'm your wingman.

296
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,900
It's just that
I've sat next to Angela

297
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,800
For a very long,
very long time.

298
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Right-O.

299
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,300
How could anyone
stand that woman?

300
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,100
- What?!
- What do you see in her?

301
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,800
Wh-What do you see
in Angela?

302
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,500
- What do I see in Angela?
- I want to know.

303
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,400
I see through
a hard exterior

304
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,300
To a little jelly
in the middle.

305
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:37,200
She is teaching me
to be a better person.

306
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,900
And she's working
really hard on that.

307
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,700
<i>And she has the softest
skin I've ever seen</i>

308
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,600
<i>And I can't wait
to have sex with her.</i>

309
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,300
<i>You haven't had sex?</i>

310
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,200
<i>No.</i>

311
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,800
<i>Y--Are you guys waiting
to get married, or?</i>

312
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Honestly,I don't know
what we're waiting for.

313
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,300
Andy, something is
wrong with that woman.

314
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,200
- What is wrong with her?
- I'd like to know.

315
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
You should call her
and ask her.

316
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,500
I'd like to know
what's wrong with her.

317
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,400
I should call her
and ask her.

318
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,700
What is wrong with her?

319
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,100
Do it.
It's a--

320
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,300
Call her.

321
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,500
Oh, my god.
Don't call her.

322
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't call her, Andy.
Andy, don't call her.

323
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,300
Too late.
Too late, it's dialing.

324
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,900
Now it's ringing.

325
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,000
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

326
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
What is wrong with you?

327
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,500
<i>- Why won't you do Andy?
- What?</i>

328
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,500
That's oscar, and he wants
to know why you won't do me,

329
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,000
And I think it's
a valid question.

330
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,600
<i>- Are you drunk?
- This is Andy Bernard.</i>

331
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,200
<i>I know who this is.</i>

332
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,800
I wanna take you
to sex school.

333
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,500
<i>What?</i>

334
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,700
<i>Who is that, monkey?</i>

335
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,200
Is somebody there?

336
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,600
<i>- Are you drunk?
- I have needs.</i>

337
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,100
<i>We will
discuss this later.</i>

338
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,700
<i>- Naked.
- What?</i>

339
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,800
We'll discuss
it later naked.

340
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,300
I want to see you naked.

341
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,500
Do you want to get
some breakfast or something?

342
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,900
<i>- I'm so tired.
- Okay.</i>

343
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,600
How does everyone
know already?

344
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,500
Know what?

345
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,000
- Pam failed art school.
- Oh, well.

346
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,700
- Doesn't surprise me.
- Excuse me?

347
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,100
Have you seen her painting,Jim?
The building?

348
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,400
There are shadows coming from
two different directions.

349
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,400
<i>- Dwight, stop it.
- Dwight.</i>

350
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,700
What?!
Are there two suns?

351
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,000
<i>- Come on.
- Oh, my god.</i>

352
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,400
Uh, last I checked,

353
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,500
That's not an office building
in the Andromeda Galaxy.

354
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
I'm gonna grab
a cup of coffee.

355
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,400
It's totally unrealistic.

356
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,500
No lines
in the parking lot.

357
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,900
Oscar.

358
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,000
Hey.

359
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,500
- That was fun last night.
- Yeah, it was.

360
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,900
You know,
it's true what they say--

361
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,000
Long Island iced teas
are way stronger in Canada.

362
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,700
Hey, um...

363
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,900
Thanks for trying
to hook me up.

364
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,800
You kiddin' me?

365
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,000
It's what I do.

366
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Get the whole
nine 'nards.

367
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,100
I can't believe
we called her up.

368
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,900
Totally.

369
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,700
What--Who?

370
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,700
I'm talking about Angela.

371
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,900
I can't believe we
called her up last night.

372
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
We called Angela?

373
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,700
You--You call--
You called her.

374
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,500
That was real?!

375
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
I thought I dreamed that.

376
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,800
- Oh, god!
- All right.

377
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Oh, god!

378
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,500
- Okay.
- So bad.

379
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Good morning,
Michael.

380
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,500
Are you ready
for the meeting?

381
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,100
Slept like a baby.

382
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,900
Mmm--This can't
happen again.

383
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,200
This has
to happen again.

384
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,500
Darryl can't
happen again.

385
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,000
Look at me.

386
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,700
Do you want me
to do more push-Ups?

387
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

388
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,300
You have to break up
with Darryl.

389
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,100
I already typed out
a text message for you.

390
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,100
All you have to do
is press "send."

391
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,100
I don't know.

392
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,800
I mean, it's well-Written
and all,I just--

393
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
Has to be done.

394
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
We'll press
"send" together.

395
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,700
Oh, my god.
He's gonna kill us.

396
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,900
I'd like
to see him try.

397
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,900
Oh! He says it's cool.

398
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,900
He said, "it's cool!"

399
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,800
That's all he wrote?

400
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,700
- That's all he wrote.
- Can I see it?

401
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
Didn't you two date
for like a long time?

402
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300
Mm-Hmm. This is
like a fairy tale!

403
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,500
I'll be honest with you--

404
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,300
We've been talking
with catalyst paper.

405
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,500
Their prices
are better than yours.

406
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,700
Look, people continue
to come back to us

407
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,700
Time and time again

408
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,300
Because they feel
cared for here.

409
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,500
They feel respected and they feel
that their needs matter.

410
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,000
They are treated
like human beings.

411
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
<i>Everything okay?</i>

412
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,000
Yes.

413
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,200
Oh, man.

414
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,200
She is so pissed.

415
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,800
- Mmm.
- She's taking us back to first base.

416
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,600
What's first base
with Angela?

417
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,600
I get to kiss
her forehead.

418
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,600
I had a good time
hangin' out this weekend.

419
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,200
I had a good time, too.

420
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Wingman for life.

421
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,400
W.M.F.L.

422
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,700
Thank you.

423
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,200
You up for
a chest bump?

424
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:38,900
No.

425
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,100
Bro hug?

426
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,400
Back to basics.

427
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,300
I like it.

428
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,600
I had to go
all the way to Canada

429
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,400
To get to know a guy
Who sits 20 feet away from me.

430
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,900
And he's delightful!

431
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,200
<i>Hey!</i>

432
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300
<i>I just heard you guys
made the sale.</i>

433
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,900
Yeah, we locked him up
for two years.

434
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,000
<i>Good, very good.
See, told you.</i>

435
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,400
<i>Sounds like somebody
had a good trip.</i>

436
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,400
No, actually,
the trip sucked.

437
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,600
<i>Excuse me?</i>

438
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,300
The trip sucked,David.

439
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,000
It blew chunks.
It was terrible.

440
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,300
It was a bad trip.

441
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I did not like the trip.</i>

442
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, starting with
the airport shuttle,

443
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,400
Which was basically
just a van.

444
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
<i>- Okay.
- And business class,</i>

445
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,700
Which was basically
just coach.

446
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,000
And the hotel
which sucked big time.

447
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,100
<i>The hotel?
What, m--Okay.</i>

448
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,200
It was not--
It sucked.

449
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,700
<i>I'm sorry to hear
the hotel was bad...</i>

450
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,300
Oh, and thanks for the tip
on the concierge.

451
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,200
That was great.
That was great.

452
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,400
That was--
That was a--

453
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,100
- <i>Okay.Okay,hey,hey,hey,Michael</i>
- That was a really good choice.

454
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,600
<i>Please.
Let's listen for a second.</i>

455
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,000
No,David,
you listen to me.

456
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,300
Why did you send her away?

457
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,000
That--God.

458
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,800
You knew I liked her
and you just sent her away

459
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,600
And that--

460
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,100
- That was a sucky thing to do,man.
- <i>Michael, sometimes--</i>

461
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,200
That was a really
sucky thing to do.

462
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,300
<i>Sometimes we--</i>

463
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,300
Why have I stayed at Dunder Mifflin
for so long?

464
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,800
Certainly not
because of the paycheck.

465
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,300
'Cause I could be making
more money as a doctor

466
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,600
Or a professional athlete.

467
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I think it's
because they respect me.

468
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,700
A boss that
will not fire you

469
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,400
Even though
you just tell him off

470
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,700
Right to his face
over the phone--

471
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,400
That's respect.

472
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
You did it, man.

473
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Day one.

474
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,100
Congrats.

475
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Thanks, man.

476
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,400
I'm coming back
the wrong way.

477
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
It's not because of you.

478
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,800
I don't like
graphic design.

479
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,000
<i>That's it.</i>

480
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,500
Stop smiling.

481
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
I really didn't like it.

482
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,000
It's just designing
logos and stuff.

483
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
And I missed Scranton.

484
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,500
But it is not
because I missed you.

485
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
I just really wanted
to come home.

486
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,800
And I know you said to come
home the right way,

487
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,200
But you can't
tell me what to do.

488
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,300
Got it?

489
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,200
I missed you.

490
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,100
I missed you, too.

491
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,000
You're back.

492
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,200
Uh, yeah.

493
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,100
Good.

494
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,400
I need you to make
five copies of these.

495
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,600
I'm not going inside.

496
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
All right.

497
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
First thing
in the morning, then.

498
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,500
Welcome back.

499
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,300
We're back together
again, baby.

500
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,200
We're back.

501
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,400
They tried to keep us apart,
But they couldn't.

502
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,600
It was like destiny.

503
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,300
I--I realized that,
for whatever reason,

504
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,900
I just couldn't do
better than Kelly.

505
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,900
- Oh!
- Yeah.
