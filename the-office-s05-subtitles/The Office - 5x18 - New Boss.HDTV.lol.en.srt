Dwight schrute,he sent out
This memo as he always does,

00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:57,477
And of course he singled me out.

117
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,450
So i just had toess with him.

118
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,810

00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,110
It was pretty crazy.

122
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,780

well... It is off

172
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,340
And actually guys,I'm
encouraging branches

173
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,040
To consider a freeze On
discretionary spending.

174
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:30,180
Such as salary benefits,Et cetera.

175
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,310
No,not- et
cetera,insurance-

176
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,455
- Not salary... petty cash.

Okay,okay,you know what?

180
00:07:41,425 --> 00:07:42,595
I think this has been great.

181
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,920
I think this gives us a lot
To think about,doesn't it?

182
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,460
Charles miner,Ladies and gentlemen.

183
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,230

Oh,no,no,no. You don't have to do that.

187
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:53,855
I've got this covered.

188
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,150
This was just a Meet
and greet,you don't-

189
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,410
No,it's a little More
involved than that.

190
00:07:56,445 --> 00:07:58,005
I'm going to set up In here,okay?

191
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,565
I am thrilled That
the new boss has taken

192
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,050
Such an active interest In
all of the responsibilities

193
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:05,660
That i'm supposed to have.

194
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,680
Thrilled.

195
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,825
David,It was my understanding

196
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,970
That i was not going To be managed.

197
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:15,840
What gave youhat idea?

198
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,385

199
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,850
Listen,why- why don't we Just
leave that position vacant?

200
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,200
Truth be told,i think i thrive
Under a lack of accountability.

201
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:30,380
Look,michael. Charles is very
qualified. Get to know him.

202
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,080
I really think the two
of you Are gonna make a g

203
00:08:33,115 --> 00:08:34,485
But the branch Is still mine?

204
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,335
You're still The branch manager,yes.

205
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,290

209
00:08:47,005 --> 00:08:49,680
Oh,okay. If we hired cirque de
soleil As salaried employees,

210
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,780
Will that help us With
the year-end tax stuff?

211
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,460

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,330
You pet the animals,They pet you back.

345
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,585
It's a great idea.

346
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,970
And we have a cake in the
shape Of a bale of hay.

347
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,645
It's really just A regular-shaped cake.

348
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,210
But it's cool,and
it's- hey,guys,you know,

349
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,570
This isn't a good use
Of company time,michael.

350
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,220

My anniversary party,so.

- I'm sorry to do that to you.
- Right.

373
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:17,140
Do you even know How paper is made?

374
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,420
It's not like steel,You
don't put it into a furnace.

375
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,750
If you put paper into a furnace,You
know what would happen? You'd ruin it.

376
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:37,880
Come in.

377
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

378
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,665
All right,charles,I got to be honest,

379
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,620
I think we really got Off
on the wrong foot here.

380
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:47,415
And truth be told,I'm
a pretty smart guy.

381
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:50,830
And a hard-worker and a great
Number two for the office.

382
00:16:50,865 --> 00:16:53,580
- Number two?
- Second in command. Toy goal.

383
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,130
Oh,i- i didn't Know
that position existed.

384
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
Oh,that's Because at first it was

385
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,870
A made up position for dwight,Just
to make him feel better.

386
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,470
Assistant To the regional manager.

387
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,870
But then he lost that,And
michael gave it to me.

388
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,440
So you're the assistant
To the regional manager?

389
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,010
Assistant regional manager,Yep.

392
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:19,410
Do you want to keep This made up
position? It's important to you?

393
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,480
All right. I will...

394
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,660

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:36,430
Hello,stephanie... Okay,where is he?

397
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,600
Michael.
What are you-

398
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,340
So is this The meeting
you' been all day?

399
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,810
How did you get here,Michael?

400
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:46,670
I drove.

401
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,825
Okay.

402
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,520
Cancelled my 15th anniversary party.

403
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,910
Just pulled the rug out From under me.

404
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,545
He said,"no figs. "

405
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,865
I've already bought them.

406
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,415
And i don't have A placto store them.

407
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,400
So i feel like i've been sort of boned.

408
00:18:02,435 --> 00:18:04,732
- Michael- - you
talk to him about this?

409
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:07,030
You've talked To him all day,obviously.

410
00:18:07,065 --> 00:18:08,870
Did you talk to him about this?

411
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,200
Well,i didn't know About
the figs,specifically-

412
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,470
Okay,then i don't get it.

413
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:13,740
It doesn't make any sense to me.

414
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,040
Because i thought In the new system,

415
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,880
That i was Supposed to talk t

416
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,540
And then charles is
Supposed to talk to you,

417
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,610
Then that will Dilute any need for me

418
00:18:20,645 --> 00:18:22,185
To ever talk to you again.

419
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,845
That's not Exactly the new system.

420
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,470
Clearly,That's what you wanted.

421
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,675
Nope. 15 years...

422
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:31,310
- I've been here,And i've sacrificed a lot.
- Yes.

423
00:18:31,345 --> 00:18:33,532
I've put Having a family on hold.

424
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:35,720
We didn't ask you to do that.

425
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,600
And i've never gone Hang-gliding.

426
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:42,220
And i've never driven my car
To the top of mount washington.

427
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,445
Okay,it was Nice meeting everyone.

428
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,570
All right,and i will See
you in a couple of weeks.

429
00:18:48,605 --> 00:18:50,150

430
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:53,430

433
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,780
See you.

434
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:05,820
Bye!

435
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:13,020
And for my next trick,I will
make my career... Disappear.

436
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,500
I can see Our kids facing obstacles,

437

Beinha black And half indian,but...

438
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:19,140
It's so worth it,you guys.

439
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,985
There's just me here.

440
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,770
I am gonna get him To buy
me a prime rib tonight.

441
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:25,930
I think he left.

442
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,080
What?!

443
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,760

444
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,040
Hello,charles!? Charles?

445
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,800
- Is that his scarf?
- No!

446
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,180
Charles and kelly? Absolutely not.

447
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,935
He is a sophisticated man.

448
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:52,960
He does not need to go dumpster
Diving for companionship. Okay?

449
00:19:52,995 --> 00:19:56,962
I don't understand
that,After 15 years...

450
00:19:56,997 --> 00:20:00,895
Of service here,I have to get in the car

451
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:03,010
And drive to new york
In order to talk to you.

452
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:04,830
That doesn't seem right to me.

453
00:20:04,865 --> 00:20:06,190
That doesn't seem fair.

454
00:20:06,225 --> 00:20:08,020
And i think...

455
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,690
That i've earned More than that.

456
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,400
